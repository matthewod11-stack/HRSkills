# Recognition Program Templates

Complete templates for building recognition programs by company size, with budgets, implementation guides, and examples.

---

## Overview: Building Your Recognition Program

**The framework:**
```
Assess Current State → Define Goals → Design Program → Pilot → Launch → Measure → Iterate
```

**Timeline:** 8-12 weeks from kickoff to full launch

---

## Template 1: Startup Recognition Program (<50 employees)

**Company profile:**
- 30-50 employees
- Budget-constrained
- Scrappy, informal culture
- High growth (headcount doubling annually)

---

### Goals

1. Build recognition culture from day one (before bad habits form)
2. Make recognition frequent and peer-driven
3. Keep it simple (minimal admin overhead)
4. Low cost (maximize impact per dollar)

---

### Program Design

#### Component 1: Peer Shout-Outs (Free)

**Platform:** Slack channel (#shoutouts or #kudos)

**How it works:**
- Anyone can post a shout-out to recognize a colleague
- Post format:

```
🙌 Shout-out to @Sarah for [specific thing they did]

Example:
🙌 Shout-out to @Sarah for staying late to help me debug the production issue. You saved our demo. Thank you!
```

**Why it works:**
- Zero cost
- Low friction (just post in Slack)
- Public (builds positive culture)
- Frequent (can happen multiple times per day)

**Launch checklist:**
- [ ] Create #shoutouts Slack channel
- [ ] CEO posts first shout-out (models behavior)
- [ ] Add to new hire onboarding ("We use #shoutouts to recognize each other")
- [ ] Encourage managers to post at least 1 shout-out per week

---

#### Component 2: Manager Spot Bonuses

**Budget:** $500 per manager per quarter

**How it works:**
- Managers can give $50-$200 spot bonuses for great work
- No approval needed (trust managers)
- Announce publicly (team meeting or #shoutouts)

**Example:**
- Tom (Engineering Manager) gives Sarah $100 for fixing critical bug
- Posts in #shoutouts:

```
💰 Spot bonus: $100 to @Sarah for fixing the auth bug that was blocking our launch. You dropped everything to help. Thank you!
```

**Budget calculation:**
```
5 managers × $500/quarter = $2,500/quarter = $10K/year
```

---

#### Component 3: Service Anniversary Gifts

**Milestones:** 1 year, 3 years, 5 years

**Rewards:**

| Milestone | Gift | Cost |
|-----------|------|------|
| **1 year** | Company swag bundle (backpack, hoodie, water bottle) + handwritten note from CEO | $100 |
| **3 years** | $300 gift card + public shout-out at all-hands | $300 |
| **5 years** | $500 experience gift + 1 extra PTO week | $500 |

**Annual cost estimate:**
```
Assume 30% annual turnover (startup)
Year 1: 10 employees hit 1-year mark = $1K
Year 2: 6 employees hit 3-year mark = $1.8K
Year 3: 3 employees hit 5-year mark = $1.5K

Total: ~$4K-$5K/year (grows as company matures)
```

---

### Total Budget

| Component | Annual Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Peer shout-outs (Slack) | $0 |
| Manager spot bonuses | $10K |
| Service anniversaries | $4K-$5K |
| **Total** | **$14K-$15K/year** |

**Per employee:** $300-$500/year (very affordable)

---

**Month 6: Measure**

## Template 2: Mid-Market Recognition Program (50-500 employees)

**Company profile:**
- 200 employees
- Established (3-5 years old)
- Growing fast
- Budget for structured programs

---

3. Celebrate milestones (service anniversaries, values awards)
4. Track and measure impact

---

### Program Design

#### Component 1: Peer Recognition Platform

**Platform:** Bonusly, Kazoo, or Lattice

**How it works:**
- Every employee gets 100 points/month to give to colleagues
- Points = $1 each, redeemable for gift cards, donations, swag
- Public feed of all recognition (builds positive culture)
- Employees can give points with a note (what they're recognizing)

**Example:**

```
Tom gives Sarah 20 points for "Helping debug the production issue last night 🙌"
Sarah now has 120 points, can redeem for $120 gift card
```

**Cost:**
- **Bonusly:** $3-$5 per employee/month
- **200 employees × $5/month = $1K/month = $12K/year (platform fee)**
- **Points budget:** 200 employees × 100 points/month × $1 = $20K/month = $240K/year
  - (Not all points are redeemed, assume 50% redemption = $120K/year actual cost)

**Total cost:** $12K platform + $120K points = **$132K/year**

---

#### Component 2: Manager Spot Bonuses

**Budget:** $2K per manager per quarter

**Scale:**
- 25 managers × $2K/quarter = $50K/quarter = **$200K/year**

**Why increase budget vs. startup?**
- More employees = more opportunities to recognize
- Larger company = higher average salaries = larger bonuses feel appropriate

---

#### Component 3: Service Anniversary Program

**Milestones:** 1, 3, 5, 10 years

**Rewards:**

| **5 years** | $1K experience fund + 1 week sabbatical + plaque | $1K |
| **10 years** | $5K experience fund + 2 weeks sabbatical + custom gift | $5K |

**Annual cost estimate:**
```
Assume 15% annual turnover (mid-market)
- 50 employees hit 1-year: $7.5K
- 20 employees hit 3-year: $7K
- 8 employees hit 5-year: $8K

## Quick-Start Recognition Program (No Budget)

**For teams that want to start immediately with zero budget:**

---

### Component 1: Weekly Team Shout-Outs

**How it works:**
- Start every team meeting with recognition (first 5 minutes)
- Each team member shares 1 thing they appreciated about a colleague this week

**Example:**
> "I want to recognize Sarah for helping me debug the API issue. She spent an hour pairing with me even though she was busy. Thank you!"

**Why it works:**
- Free
- Builds team bond
- Frequent (weekly)

---

### Component 2: Handwritten Thank-You Notes

**How it works:**
- Managers write handwritten notes to team members for great work
- Personal, specific, sincere
- Mail to home address (surprise factor)

**Cost:** $1 per note (card + stamp)

**Why it works:**
- Low cost
- High emotional impact (handwritten notes are rare and memorable)

---

### Component 3: "Caught in the Act" Cards

**How it works:**
- Print "Caught in the Act of Awesome" cards (template below)
- Employees fill out when they see great work
- Give card to colleague + email copy to their manager

**Template:**

```
🌟 CAUGHT IN THE ACT OF AWESOME 🌟

To: _______________________

You were caught doing something awesome!

What you did:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

Impact:
_________________________________________________
_________________________________________________

From: _______________________
Date: _______________________
```

**Cost:** $20 for 100 cards (printed on cardstock)

## Implementation Checklist (Universal)

**Regardless of company size, follow this checklist:**

---

**Step 1: Define "Why"**
- [ ] What behaviors do we want to reinforce?
- [ ] What culture do we want to build?
- [ ] What problem are we solving? (low engagement? high turnover?)

---

**Step 2: Assess Current State**
- [ ] Survey: "I feel recognized when I do good work" (baseline score)
- [ ] How often is recognition happening today? (rarely? never?)
- [ ] What programs exist? (none? outdated "Employee of the Month"?)

---

**Step 3: Design Program**
- [ ] Choose components (peer recognition, spot bonuses, anniversaries, awards)
- [ ] Set budget (1-2% of payroll)
- [ ] Define rewards (what will we give? cash? experiences? time off?)

---

**Step 4: Get Buy-In**
- [ ] Present business case to leadership (engagement → retention → cost savings)
- [ ] Get budget approval
- [ ] Secure CEO sponsorship (must model recognition)

---

**Step 5: Build**
- [ ] Select platform (if using software)
- [ ] Create program guidelines (what gets recognized? how much?)
- [ ] Design communication plan (how will we launch?)

---

**Step 6: Train**
- [ ] Train managers on recognition (1-hour session)
- [ ] Provide templates and examples
- [ ] Set expectations (recognize at least 1 person/week)

---

**Step 7: Launch**
- [ ] CEO announces program (all-hands + email)
- [ ] Managers start recognizing
- [ ] Employees start using peer recognition tools

---

**Step 8: Measure**
- [ ] Track metrics (# recognitions/week, manager participation)
- [ ] Survey: "I feel recognized" (measure improvement)
- [ ] Analyze turnover (recognized vs. non-recognized employees)
- [ ] Calculate ROI

---

**Step 9: Iterate**
- [ ] What's working? (do more of it)
- [ ] What's not working? (fix or kill it)
- [ ] Gather feedback (quarterly pulse survey)
- [ ] Adjust budget/program as needed

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Start small** - Don't need huge budget to build recognition culture (start with Slack channel)
2. **Make it frequent** - Recognition should happen weekly, not annually
3. **Empower managers** - Give managers budget and trust them to use it
4. **Measure impact** - Track sentiment, turnover, ROI
5. **Iterate** - Programs evolve as company grows

**Great recognition programs = frequent, meaningful, easy to use.**
