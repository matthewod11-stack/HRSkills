# Values Awards Framework

Complete guide to designing annual awards programs that reinforce company values, including nomination processes, selection criteria, and award ceremonies.

---

## Overview: Values-Based Awards

**What are values awards?**

Annual recognition program where employees who exemplify company values win awards.

**Why values awards?**

1. **Reinforce culture:** Shows what living the values actually looks like
2. **Make values concrete:** Values posters on wall = abstract. Award winners = real examples
3. **Inspire others:** "If I want to win, I should act like Sarah acted"
4. **Retain top performers:** Awards recognize and reward best employees

**The shift:**

**Old model (❌):**
- "Employee of the Year" (1 winner out of 500 employees)
- Chosen by execs behind closed doors
- Criteria vague ("who worked hardest?")

**New model (✅):**
- Multiple awards (1 per company value)
- Peer-nominated (anyone can nominate)
- Criteria clear (exemplifies specific value)
- Transparent process

---

## Step 1: Define Your Awards

### Map Awards to Company Values

**Formula:** 1 award per core company value

**Example: Company with 4 values**

| Company Value | Award Name | Description |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **Customer Obsession** | Customer Hero Award | For someone who went above and beyond for a customer |
| **Innovation** | Innovation Award | For someone who shipped a creative solution to a hard problem |
| **Ownership** | Ownership Award | For someone who owned a problem and drove it to completion |
| **Collaboration** | Team Player Award | For someone who helped others succeed |

**Result:** 4 awards (1 per value)

---

### Additional Award Categories (Optional)

**Beyond values, consider:**

**Rising Star Award**
- For high-potential individual contributor (not manager)
- Someone who's grown significantly this year
- Future leader

**Leadership Award**
- For best people manager
- Someone who develops, coaches, and inspires their team

**Lifetime Achievement Award**
- For long-tenured employee (10+ years)
- Recognizes career-long impact

**Founder's Award (CEO's Choice)**
- CEO selects one person who had outsized impact
- Can overlap with values awards or be separate

---

### Example: Full Awards Program

**Company:** 300 employees, 4 core values

**Awards:**

| Award | Description | Winner(s) |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Customer Hero** | Customer obsession | 1 winner |
| **Innovation** | Creative problem-solving | 1 winner |
| **Ownership** | Drives results | 1 winner |
| **Team Player** | Collaboration | 1 winner |
| **Rising Star** | High-potential IC | 1 winner |
| **Leadership** | Best people manager | 1 winner |
| **Founder's Award** | CEO's choice | 1 winner |

**Total winners:** 7 (out of 300 employees = 2.3% win)

---

## Step 2: Design the Nomination Process

### Open Nominations (Anyone Can Nominate)

**Why open nominations?**
- **Democratic:** Everyone has a voice
- **Uncovers hidden heroes:** Peers see work that managers miss
- **Drives engagement:** Employees feel involved in process

**Nomination form template:**

```
VALUES AWARD NOMINATION FORM

Nominee Name: ___________________________

Award Category: [Dropdown: Customer Hero, Innovation, Ownership, Team Player, Rising Star, Leadership]

Your Name (Nominator): ___________________________

1. What did this person do that exemplifies this award?
   (Specific example, 200-500 words)

   ___________________________________________
   ___________________________________________

2. What was the impact of their actions?
   (Business impact, customer impact, team impact)

   ___________________________________________
   ___________________________________________

3. How does this person embody [Company Value]?
   (Connect to specific value)

   ___________________________________________
   ___________________________________________
```

**Best practices:**

- **Keep it short:** 3 questions, max 500 words
- **Require specifics:** "What did they do?" (not just "they're great")
- **Deadline:** 2-3 weeks for nominations (enough time, not too long)

---

### Nomination Timeline

**Example: Annual awards announced in December**

| Date | Activity |
|------|----------|
| **Oct 1** | Open nominations (launch email, all-hands announcement) |
| **Oct 1-21** | Nomination period (3 weeks) |
| **Oct 22-31** | Selection committee reviews nominations |
| **Nov 1-15** | Committee selects finalists, conducts interviews (if needed) |
| **Nov 16-30** | Committee selects winners |
| **Dec 1-10** | CEO notifies winners privately, plans ceremony |
| **Dec 15** | Award ceremony (annual event or all-hands) |

**Total timeline:** 2.5 months from nomination launch to ceremony

---

### Encouraging Nominations

**Challenge:** How do you get employees to nominate people?

**Tactics:**

**1. Manager push**
- Managers encourage team to nominate in team meetings
- "Think about who on your team or cross-functionally did something amazing this year"

**2. Reminders**
- Email reminders at 1 week left, 3 days left, last day
- Slack posts in #general

**3. Make it visible**
- Share nomination count publicly ("50 nominations so far! Keep them coming!")

**4. Gamify (optional)**
- Team with most nominations gets lunch with CEO

**Goal:** 50-100+ nominations (for 300-employee company)

---

## Step 3: Selection Process

### Form Selection Committee

**Who should be on the committee?**

**Option 1: Cross-functional leadership**
- VP of each department (Eng, Sales, Marketing, Ops, People)
- CEO
- **Total:** 5-7 people

**Option 2: Peer committee**
- Mix of managers and individual contributors
- Rotates annually (different committee each year)
- Nominated by employees or selected by CEO
- **Total:** 5-10 people

**Best practice:** Include at least 1-2 individual contributors (not just execs)

---

### Selection Criteria

**How to evaluate nominations:**

**Scoring rubric (1-5 scale):**

| Criteria | Weight | Score (1-5) |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Exemplifies value** (Is this a clear example of the value?) | 40% | ___ |
| **Impact** (Did their actions have meaningful business/customer impact?) | 30% | ___ |
| **Specificity** (Is nomination specific with concrete examples?) | 20% | ___ |
| **Going above and beyond** (Is this exceptional, not just doing their job?) | 10% | ___ |

**Total score:** Out of 5.0

**Example:**

**Nomination:** Sarah for Customer Hero Award

**Evaluation:**

- **Exemplifies value:** 5/5 (stayed on call 2 hours to fix customer issue on Friday night - clear customer obsession)
- **Impact:** 5/5 (customer was going to churn, this saved the account worth $100K ARR)
- **Specificity:** 5/5 (nomination has concrete details, timestamps, customer quotes)
- **Above and beyond:** 5/5 (Friday night, not expected, went far beyond job duty)

**Total score:** 5.0 / 5.0 (top candidate)

---

### Selection Meeting

**Process:**

**Step 1: Committee members review all nominations (async)**
- Each committee member scores all nominations independently
- **Deadline:** 1 week before selection meeting

**Step 2: Selection meeting (2-3 hours)**
- Review top-scored nominations for each award
- Discuss: Do we agree? Any concerns?
- Vote (if needed): Each committee member votes for top 3 candidates
- **Output:** 1 winner per award category (or 2-3 finalists if tie)

**Step 3: Finalist interviews (optional)**
- If tie or need more context, interview finalists
- Ask: "Tell us about [the situation in your nomination]"
- Committee decides after interviews

**Step 4: Final decision**
- CEO has final say (or committee votes)
- Winners selected

---

### Handling Ties

**If 2 candidates are equally strong:**

**Option 1: Co-winners**
- Both win the award (split prize if monetary)
- Announce both at ceremony

**Option 2: Create "Honorable Mention"**
- 1 winner, 1-2 honorable mentions
- Honorable mentions get smaller prize + recognition

**Option 3: CEO tie-breaker**
- CEO reviews both nominations and picks one

---

## Step 4: Award Design (What Do Winners Get?)

### Monetary Rewards

**Typical prize amounts:**

**Startup (<100 employees):**
- **Prize:** $500-$1K per award
- **Total budget:** 4 awards × $1K = $4K

**Mid-market (100-500 employees):**
- **Prize:** $2K-$3K per award
- **Total budget:** 6 awards × $2.5K = $15K

**Enterprise (500+ employees):**
- **Prize:** $5K-$10K per award
- **Total budget:** 8 awards × $7.5K = $60K

---

## Measuring Success

### Metrics to Track

**1. Nomination participation**

**Formula:**
```
Participation rate = (# employees who nominated someone / total employees) × 100%
```

**Goal:** 30%+ of employees nominate someone

**Example:**
- 300 employees
- 100 employees submitted nominations
- Participation = 100 / 300 = 33% ✅

---

**2. Employee sentiment**

**Survey question (post-awards):**
"The annual awards program makes me proud to work here"
- Strongly Disagree → Strongly Agree (5-point scale)

**Goal:** 80%+ favorable

---

**3. Values awareness**

**Survey question:**
"I can give specific examples of colleagues who live our values"
- Before awards: 50% say "yes"
- After awards: 75% say "yes" (+25 points)

**Why it works:** Awards make values concrete (employees can point to Sarah as example of "customer obsession")

---

**4. Retention of winners**

**Track:**
- What % of award winners are still at company 1 year later?
- What % of award winners are still at company 2 years later?

**Hypothesis:** Award winners have higher retention (they feel valued)

**Example:**
```
Award winners (7 people):
- 1-year retention: 100% (all 7 still here)
- 2-year retention: 86% (6 of 7 still here)

Non-winners:
- 1-year retention: 85%
- 2-year retention: 72%

Award winners are 14 percentage points more likely to stay
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Opaque process

**What it looks like:** Execs pick winners behind closed doors, no one knows how decisions are made

**Why it fails:** Employees don't trust process, feels political

**Fix:** Open nominations, clear criteria, committee with diverse perspectives

---

### Mistake 2: Same people win every year

**What it looks like:** Sarah wins every award, every year

**Why it fails:** Everyone else stops trying

**Fix:** Rule: Can't win same award 2 years in a row (can win different award)

---

### Mistake 3: Too many awards

**What it looks like:** 25 award categories, 50% of company wins something

**Why it fails:** Awards lose meaning (everyone wins = no one wins)

**Fix:** Keep it selective (5-10 awards max, <5% of company wins)

---

### Mistake 4: Vague nominations

**What it looks like:** Nomination says "Sarah is great!" (no specifics)

**Why it fails:** Committee can't evaluate

**Fix:** Require specific examples in nomination form (200+ words)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tie awards to values** - 1 award per company value
2. **Open nominations** - Anyone can nominate (democratic, uncovers heroes)
3. **Clear criteria** - Rubric for evaluating nominations (specific, impact, exemplifies value)
4. **Meaningful prizes** - $5K+ cash bonus + trophy + recognition
5. **Celebrate publicly** - Ceremony with video tributes, speeches, photos
6. **Measure impact** - Track participation, sentiment, retention

**Great values awards = reinforce culture, recognize top performers, inspire everyone.**
