## Multi-State Employer Considerations

If you operate in multiple states:

- [ ] **Create state-specific addendums** to your employee handbook
- [ ] **Use the most protective state law** when in doubt (e.g., if CA requires meal breaks, apply to all employees if simpler)
- [ ] **Track where employees work** (work location determines applicable state law, even for remote employees)
- [ ] **Consult employment attorneys in each state** where you have employees

## Common Compliance Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using an out-of-state handbook template
**Fix:** Ensure your handbook reflects the laws in each state where you have employees.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Forgetting to update handbooks when laws change
**Fix:** Review and update your handbook at least annually. Subscribe to employment law updates.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Overly broad confidentiality or social media policies
**Fix:** NLRB says employees can discuss wages, working conditions, and form unions. Don't ban this.

### ❌ Mistake 4: No at-will employment disclaimer
**Fix:** Include a clear, conspicuous at-will disclaimer and require acknowledgment.

### ❌ Mistake 5: Promising job security
**Fix:** Avoid language like "employees will only be terminated for cause." Use "may" instead of "will."

### ❌ Mistake 6: Not tracking handbook acknowledgments
**Fix:** Require signed acknowledgment forms and store them in employee files.

### ❌ Mistake 7: Ignoring contractor classification (AB 5, ABC test)
**Fix:** Ensure contractors meet the legal test. Misclassification can result in fines and back pay.

### ❌ Mistake 8: No whistleblower protection policy
**Fix:** Required for public companies (SOX) and increasingly required by states. Add a policy.
