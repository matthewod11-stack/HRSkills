## Policy Acknowledgment Tracker

Track which employees have acknowledged each version of the handbook.

### Option 1: Simple Spreadsheet

| Employee Name | Hire Date | Handbook Version | Acknowledgment Date | Signature (Y/N) |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Jane Doe | 2022-05-10 | v2.0 (2023-03-01) | 2023-03-15 | Y |
| John Smith | 2020-08-01 | v2.0 (2023-03-01) | 2023-03-10 | Y |
| Maria Garcia | 2023-06-15 | v2.0 (2023-03-01) | 2023-06-16 | Y |

**Store signed acknowledgment forms** in employee files (paper or digital).

---

### Option 2: Detailed Tracking (for Annual Updates)

When you release a new handbook version, track who's acknowledged it:

| Employee Name | Department | Current Version | New Version Required | Date Sent | Date Acknowledged | Follow-Up Needed |
|---------------|------------|----------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Jane Doe | Engineering | v1.1 | v2.0 | 2023-03-01 | 2023-03-05 | No |
| John Smith | Sales | v1.1 | v2.0 | 2023-03-01 | — | Yes (reminder sent 3/10) |
| Maria Garcia | Marketing | v2.0 | v2.0 | — | 2023-06-16 | No (new hire) |

**Use this to:**
- Track who hasn't acknowledged yet (send reminders)
- Ensure 100% acknowledgment before rollout is complete
- Identify employees who need follow-up training

## Policy Rollout Checklist

Use this checklist every time you create or update a major policy.

### Phase 1: Policy Creation
- [ ] Identify need (legal requirement, business need, risk mitigation)
- [ ] Research relevant laws (federal, state, industry)
- [ ] Draft policy (use templates from `policy-library.md`)
- [ ] Review with stakeholders (leadership, affected departments)
- [ ] Legal review (employment attorney)
- [ ] Final approval (CEO, board if applicable)

### Phase 2: Communication Planning
- [ ] Determine effective date (at least 30 days notice for major changes)
- [ ] Create communication plan:
  - [ ] All-hands announcement
  - [ ] Email to all employees
  - [ ] Manager talking points
  - [ ] FAQ document
- [ ] Plan training (if needed):
  - [ ] Manager training (how to enforce policy)
  - [ ] Employee training (especially for compliance policies like anti-harassment)

### Phase 3: Rollout
- [ ] Update employee handbook
- [ ] Post updated handbook to intranet/shared drive
- [ ] Announce policy:
  - [ ] CEO/leadership email
  - [ ] All-hands presentation
  - [ ] Slack/Teams announcement
- [ ] Distribute acknowledgment form (electronic or paper)
- [ ] Track acknowledgments (see tracker above)
- [ ] Send reminders to employees who haven't acknowledged

### Phase 4: Post-Rollout
- [ ] 100% acknowledgment achieved
- [ ] Archive old policy version
- [ ] Update policy tracker spreadsheet
- [ ] Schedule annual review date
- [ ] Conduct training (if required)
- [ ] Monitor compliance (spot-check enforcement, collect feedback)

---

## Policy Review Calendar

Schedule policy reviews to ensure you stay compliant and up-to-date.

### Annual Review (Minimum)
Review all policies at least once per year, even if no changes are needed.

**Recommended Schedule:**
- **Q1 (January-March):** Review compensation, benefits, and time off policies (before annual enrollment, raises)
- **Q2 (April-June):** Review workplace conduct, code of ethics, anti-harassment (refresh training)
- **Q3 (July-September):** Review performance management, discipline, and separation policies
- **Q4 (October-December):** Review employment basics, compliance policies, prepare for new year

---

### Trigger Events (Review Immediately)
Review and update policies when:
- **New law or regulation** (e.g., new state sick leave law, EEOC guidance)
- **Court ruling** impacts your industry or state
- **Business change** (e.g., going remote, opening new office, new benefits)
- **Employee relations issue** reveals policy gap (e.g., harassment complaint highlights weak reporting process)
- **Acquisition or merger** (align policies across companies)

---

## Example: Policy Change Log

Track the history of changes to a specific policy.

### Policy: Remote Work Policy

| Date | Version | Change Description | Reason | Approved By |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| 2019-12-01 | 1.0 | Initial remote work policy created. Allows 1 day/week remote for select roles. | Pilot program | CEO |
| 2020-03-20 | 2.0 | Emergency update: All employees work remotely due to COVID-19 pandemic. Added security requirements (VPN, 2FA). | COVID-19 pandemic | CEO, IT |
| 2021-09-01 | 2.1 | Updated to hybrid model: Employees in office 2-3 days/week. Added core hours requirement (10 AM - 3 PM). | Return to office planning | CEO, Ops |
| 2023-09-01 | 3.0 | Major revision: Fully flexible remote/hybrid model. Removed mandatory in-office days. Added guidance on international remote work (not allowed without approval). | Talent retention, competitive market | CEO, Legal, HR |

**Why track this?**
- Understand the rationale for past changes
- Identify patterns (e.g., "We update this policy every time we hire in a new state")
- Provide context for employees ("Here's why we changed this")

## Employee Acknowledgment Form Template

Every employee must sign this form when they receive the handbook (or when it's updated).

---

**EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM**

**Employee Name:** ______________________________

**Date of Hire:** ______________________________

**Department:** ______________________________

---

I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the [Company Name] Employee Handbook, Version [X.X], dated [Effective Date].

I understand that:

1. **I am responsible for reading, understanding, and complying with all policies in this handbook.**

2. **My employment is at-will.** This means that either I or the company may terminate my employment at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. Nothing in this handbook, my offer letter, or any other company document creates an employment contract.

3. **This handbook is not a contract.** It is a guide to company policies and may be changed, modified, or rescinded by the company at any time, with or without notice.

4. **No manager or representative of the company has the authority to alter the at-will employment relationship,** except the [CEO/authorized officer] in a written agreement signed by both the employee and the [CEO/authorized officer].

5. **This handbook supersedes all prior handbooks, policies, and practices.**

6. **If I have questions about any policy, I will ask my manager or contact HR at [email/phone].**

7. **I will report any violations of company policy or concerns about workplace conduct to my manager, HR, or via the anonymous hotline at [number/link].**

---

**I have read and understood this acknowledgment.**

**Employee Signature:** ______________________________

**Date:** ______________________________

---

**For HR Use Only:**

Acknowledgment received by: ______________________________

Date filed: ______________________________

Location of signed form: ______________________________ (Employee file)

---

## Digital Acknowledgment (E-Signature)

If using e-signature tools (DocuSign, HelloSign, Adobe Sign):

**Include in e-signature workflow:**
- [ ] Full handbook attached as PDF
- [ ] Acknowledgment language (same as above)
- [ ] Checkboxes for key statements:
  - [ ] I acknowledge receipt of the handbook
  - [ ] I understand my employment is at-will
  - [ ] I understand this handbook is not a contract
  - [ ] I agree to comply with all policies
- [ ] Electronic signature and date
- [ ] Automatic filing to employee record in HRIS

---

## Policy Compliance Monitoring

After rolling out a policy, monitor compliance:

### Metrics to Track
- **Acknowledgment Rate:** % of employees who've acknowledged the policy
- **Training Completion:** % of employees who've completed required training (e.g., harassment prevention)
- **Policy Violations:** Number of reported violations (track by policy, department, severity)
- **Time to Resolution:** Average time to resolve policy violations or complaints

### Monthly/Quarterly Review
- [ ] Review acknowledgment tracker: Follow up with employees who haven't signed
- [ ] Review training completion: Send reminders for overdue training
- [ ] Review violations: Identify patterns (e.g., one department has frequent attendance issues)
- [ ] Manager feedback: Are policies clear? Are they enforceable?

---

## Policy Sunset / Archive Process

When a policy is no longer needed:

1. **Mark as "Archived"** in policy tracker
2. **Communicate to employees** (e.g., "We're replacing our old Travel Policy with a simpler Expense Reimbursement policy")
3. **Remove from active handbook** but keep archived copy
4. **Retain archived policy** for legal purposes (7+ years recommended)

**Why archive instead of delete?**
- Legal defense: If an employee sues for something that happened under the old policy, you need to prove what the policy was at the time
- Audit trail: Track the evolution of your policies over time

---

## Example Timeline: Rolling Out a New Policy

**Policy:** Parental Leave Policy (new benefit)

**Timeline:** 90 days from decision to effective date

| Week | Task | Owner |
|------|------|-------|
| Week 1-2 | Draft policy, benchmark competitors, determine budget | HR |
| Week 3 | Legal review (employment attorney) | HR, Legal |
| Week 4 | Present to leadership for approval | HR → CEO |
| Week 5-6 | Finalize policy, create communication materials (email, FAQ, all-hands deck) | HR |
| Week 7 | Announce policy at all-hands ("Coming in 30 days...") | CEO |
| Week 8 | Distribute updated handbook, send acknowledgment forms | HR |
| Week 9-10 | Track acknowledgments, send reminders | HR |
| Week 11 | Manager training (how to support employees on parental leave) | HR |
| Week 12 | Policy goes live (effective date) | HR |
| Week 13+ | Monitor usage, collect feedback, adjust as needed | HR |

## Best Practices

### Do:
✅ **Version control everything:** Track versions, dates, and changes
✅ **Get 100% acknowledgment:** Don't let employees skip it
✅ **Review annually:** Laws change, business changes
✅ **Communicate clearly:** Explain the "why" behind policy changes
✅ **Archive old versions:** Legal protection

### Don't:
❌ **Don't skip legal review:** Especially for high-risk policies (harassment, termination, wage/hour)
❌ **Don't surprise employees:** Give at least 30 days' notice for major changes
❌ **Don't forget remote employees:** Send posters, handbooks electronically
❌ **Don't lose acknowledgment forms:** Store securely (you'll need them in litigation)
