# Onboarding Best Practices

Research-backed principles for effective onboarding.

---

## The Data

**Poor onboarding impact:**
- 33% of new hires actively look for new job within 6 months
- 23% of new hires leave within first year
- Average cost to replace: 6-9 months salary
- Lost productivity: 3-6 months to full ramp

**Great onboarding impact:**
- 69% more likely to stay 3+ years (SHRM study)
- 58% more likely to still be there after 3 years (Glassdoor)
- 2.5x more likely to report high job satisfaction
- 50% faster time-to-productivity

**ROI is massive:** For every $1 spent improving onboarding, companies see $4-$6 return.

## The Four C's of Onboarding

### 1. Compliance
**What:** Legal and policy requirements
- Paperwork (I-9, W-4, benefits enrollment)
- Policies (handbook, code of conduct)
- Required training (harassment, security, compliance)

**Best Practice:**
- Complete BEFORE Day 1 (pre-boarding)
- Don't make Day 1 all paperwork (boring!)
- Use digital tools (DocuSign, BambooHR, etc.)

### 2. Clarification
**What:** Understanding role and expectations
- What's my job?
- How is success measured?
- What are my goals?
- How do we work here?

**Best Practice:**
- First day: manager explains role clearly
- First week: written goals and expectations
- 30 days: clarity on success metrics

### 3. Culture
**What:** Organizational norms and values
- How do we make decisions?
- What behaviors are rewarded?
- What's the unwritten rules?
- How do we communicate?

**Best Practice:**
- Meet diverse group of people (not just team)
- Stories that illustrate values
- Observe team meetings and interactions
- Buddy system (cultural translator)

### 4. Connection
**What:** Interpersonal relationships
- Manager relationship
- Peer relationships
- Cross-functional relationships
- Sense of belonging

**Best Practice:**
- Manager makes time (daily Week 1, weekly Month 1)
- Buddy system (peer support)
- Team social activities
- Introductions facilitated (not left to chance)

## The 5 Milestones of Onboarding

### Milestone 1: Day 1 (The Welcome)
**Goal:** Feel welcomed, excited, not overwhelmed

**Do:**
- ✅ Manager greets personally (not HR)
- ✅ Workspace ready (equipment, access)
- ✅ Team welcome (lunch, informal intro)
- ✅ Ship something (even tiny)
- ✅ Check-in at end of day

**Don't:**
- ❌ Dump information (death by deck)
- ❌ Leave them alone (awkward)
- ❌ All paperwork (boring)
- ❌ No plan (unstructured)

### Milestone 2: Week 1 (The Foundation)
**Goal:** Understand basics, build relationships

**Do:**
- ✅ Meet team and key people
- ✅ Learn tools and systems
- ✅ Ship small project
- ✅ Daily buddy check-ins
- ✅ Week 1 retro with manager

**Don't:**
- ❌ Overwhelm with information
- ❌ Expect full productivity
- ❌ Skip check-ins
- ❌ Leave them to "figure it out"

### Milestone 3: 30 Days (The Contributor)
**Goal:** Delivering value, feeling productive

**Do:**
- ✅ Formal 30-day check-in
- ✅ Shipped meaningful work
- ✅ Clear goals for next 30 days
- ✅ Address any concerns early

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip check-in (catches issues)
- ❌ Assume all is well
- ❌ Let problems fester

### Milestone 4: 60 Days (The Producer)
**Goal:** Full contributor, less support needed

**Do:**
- ✅ Operating at hired level
- ✅ Mentoring others
- ✅ Taking ownership
- ✅ Career conversation starts

**Don't:**
- ❌ Still hand-holding (should be autonomous)
- ❌ No feedback (need to know how they're doing)

### Milestone 5: 90 Days (The Team Member)
**Goal:** Fully ramped, part of the culture

**Do:**
- ✅ Formal performance review
- ✅ Career development plan
- ✅ Transition to normal cadence
- ✅ Get feedback on onboarding (improve program)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Skip formal review (sets tone)
- ❌ Keep treating as "new hire"

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Start Before Day 1 (Pre-Boarding)
**Why:** 22% of turnover happens in first 45 days (often from buyer's remorse)

**Pre-boarding activities:**
- Welcome email from manager (personal)
- Equipment shipped early
- Accounts provisioned
- First day agenda shared
- Buddy assigned and introduced
- Company swag sent

**Impact:** New hires who experience pre-boarding are 68% more likely to say onboarding was excellent.

### 2. Manager Involvement (Not Just HR)
**Why:** Relationship with manager is #1 predictor of retention

**Manager must:**
- Welcome personally on Day 1
- Daily check-ins Week 1
- Weekly 1:1s for first 90 days
- Formal check-ins at 30/60/90
- Career conversation by 90 days

**Bad:** Delegate onboarding to HR or buddy

### 3. Buddy System
**Why:** Peer support reduces stress, accelerates learning

**Good buddy:**
- Peer-level (not manager)
- Strong performer
- Cultural ambassador
- Wants to help

**Buddy responsibilities:**
- Daily check-ins Week 1
- Weekly check-ins Month 1
- Answer questions anytime
- Cultural translator (unwritten rules)

**Train buddies:** 30-min training before new hire starts

### 4. Ship Something Day 1
**Why:** Psychological win, feel productive immediately

**Examples:**
- Fix small bug
- Add test
- Update docs
- Deploy to staging

**Not:** Major feature (too ambitious)

**Impact:** Employees who ship Day 1 report 40% higher engagement at 30 days.

### 5. Structured but Flexible
**Why:** Balance guidance with autonomy

**Structure:**
- Clear plan (what happens when)
- Checklists (know what to do)
- Milestones (30/60/90)
- Regular check-ins

**Flexibility:**
- Adapt to individual (senior ramps faster)
- Adjust based on feedback
- Don't rigidly stick to plan if not working

### 6. Measure and Iterate
**Why:** What gets measured gets improved

**Track:**
- New hire satisfaction (30/60/90 surveys)
- Time to first commit/contribution
- Time to full productivity
- 90-day performance ratings
- 1-year retention

**Quarterly:**
- Review feedback from all new hires
- Identify gaps
- Update program
- Train managers and buddies

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Information Overload
**Symptom:** "Here are 50 docs to read"
**Fix:** Just-in-time learning (learn what you need, when you need it)

### 2. Leaving Them Alone
**Symptom:** "Just shadow people and ask questions"
**Fix:** Structured plan, daily check-ins

### 3. All Learning, No Doing
**Symptom:** Two weeks of training before touching code
**Fix:** Mix learning and shipping from Day 1

### 4. No Clear Success Metrics
**Symptom:** "Not sure what I should be doing"
**Fix:** Clear goals at 30/60/90, defined success criteria

### 5. Skipping Check-Ins
**Symptom:** No formal 30/60/90 reviews
**Fix:** Calendar them before Day 1, don't skip

### 6. One-Size-Fits-All
**Symptom:** Same onboarding for junior and senior
**Fix:** Customize by level (seniors need less structure)

### 7. Ends at Day 30
**Symptom:** Great first month, then neglect
**Fix:** Onboarding is 90 days minimum

### 8. No Feedback Loop
**Symptom:** Same onboarding problems every time
**Fix:** Ask new hires for feedback, iterate

## Special Situations

### Remote Onboarding
**Extra challenges:** Harder to build relationships, observe culture

**Additions:**
- More frequent video check-ins
- Virtual coffee chats (forced)
- Ship equipment 3-5 days early
- Zoom buddy pairings (pair programming)
- Slack community for new hires
- Consider flying in for Day 1 (if budget allows)

### Senior Hires (IC4+, Director+)
**Different needs:** Less hand-holding, more strategic context

**Adjust:**
- Less structured (trust their process)
- More context (strategy, why we do things)
- Stakeholder introductions (broader network)
- Faster autonomy (own projects Week 2)
- Still do check-ins (don't neglect)

### Manager Onboarding
**Unique challenges:** Managing team while learning

**Additions:**
- 1:1s with all reports Week 1 (get to know team)
- Management training
- Observe before changing (don't come in hot)
- Partner with HR on people issues
- Manager buddy (another manager)

### Interns
**Different timeline:** 10-12 weeks, not 90 days

**Adjust:**
- Faster ramp (Week 1 = onboarding, Week 2 = contributing)
- Structured project (defined start and end)
- More mentorship (pair daily)
- No expectation of full productivity
- Conversion funnel (evaluate for full-time)
