## Using These Examples

**For Creating Individual Plans:**
1. Start with role template (Engineer, Sales, etc.)
2. Customize for the person (their experience, team, manager)
3. Add specific names, dates, projects
4. Set clear milestones and check-ins

**For Creating Programs:**
1. Generalize the plan (remove names, specific dates)
2. Make it repeatable (templates, checklists)
3. Train managers and buddies
4. Iterate based on feedback
