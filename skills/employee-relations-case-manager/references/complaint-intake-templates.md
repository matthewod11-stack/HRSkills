## Key Principles

1. **Document everything** - Contemporaneous notes are legal evidence
2. **Use their words** - Verbatim quotes, not your interpretation
3. **Be thorough** - Get all details in intake
4. **Stay neutral** - Don't express opinions or judgments
5. **Explain process** - Complainant should know what to expect
6. **Safety first** - Address immediate risks before investigation
7. **Confidentiality limits** - Be honest about what you can/can't keep private
8. **No promises** - Commit to process, not specific outcome

Good intake = good investigation. The more detail you capture upfront, the stronger your investigation.
