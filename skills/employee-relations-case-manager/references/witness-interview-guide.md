# Witness Interview Guide

Comprehensive guide to conducting effective investigation interviews with legal compliance.

---

## Interview Fundamentals

### **Always have two interviewers:**
- **Lead interviewer:** Asks questions, engages with witness
- **Note-taker:** Documents responses verbatim, observes demeanor

**Why:** Corroboration (two people's memory > one), reduces liability (no "he said/she said" about interview), allows lead to focus on questioning

---

### **Location:**
- **Private:** Conference room, closed office, private Zoom
- **Neutral:** Not accused's office, not intimidating location
- **Uninterrupted:** No phones, no drop-ins, do not disturb

---

### **Timing:**
- **Duration:** 1-2 hours (allow sufficient time)
- **Breaks:** Offer breaks, especially if emotional
- **Scheduling:** Give witness advance notice (24-48 hours), don't ambush

---

### **Recording:**
**General rule: Don't record**
- Some states require all-party consent
- Recording can chill candor
- Notes are sufficient and standard practice

**Exception:** If you do record (rare), disclose upfront and get consent

---

## Interview Structure

### Phase 1: Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Introductions:**
"Thank you for meeting with us. I'm [Name] and this is [Note-taker]. I'm [role - HR Director, investigator, etc.]."

---

**Purpose:**
"We're looking into a workplace matter, and your name came up as someone who may have information that could help. I want to be clear upfront: this is not about you. You're not in trouble. We just want to understand what happened."

---

**Confidentiality:**
"I'm going to ask you to keep our conversation confidential. Please don't discuss what we talk about today with coworkers, including [complainant] or [accused]. The only people who will know the content of this interview are those who need to know to conduct this investigation - typically HR, legal, and potentially the parties involved if their statement comes up. Can you agree to that?"

**Important:** You CANNOT promise absolute confidentiality (you may need to share their statement with accused as part of due process). Be honest.

---

**No Retaliation:**
"The company strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who participates in an investigation. This means no one can treat you negatively for being here or for what you say. If you experience any retaliation - any negative treatment - please report it to me or HR immediately. Do you understand?"

---

**Honesty:**
"I need you to be completely honest with me. If you remember something, tell me. If you don't remember, say you don't remember - don't guess or speculate. If you're not sure, say you're not sure. Is that clear?"

---

**Note-taking:**
"We'll be taking notes throughout this conversation. [Note-taker] will be writing down what you say, and I may take notes as well. We won't be recording this, just writing. We want to capture your words accurately. Is that okay?"

---

**Questions before starting:**
"Do you have any questions before we begin?"

[Answer any questions truthfully but don't reveal details of the investigation]

---

### Phase 2: Background (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Establish credibility, context, relationship to parties

**Questions:**
1. "How long have you worked at [Company]?"
2. "What's your role?"
3. "Who do you report to?"
4. "How long have you known [complainant]?"
5. "How long have you known [accused]?"
6. "How often do you interact with them?"
7. "What's your working relationship like with each of them?"

**Red flags:**
- Close friends with one party (bias)
- Conflict with one party (motive to lie)
- No direct knowledge (hearsay)

---

### Phase 3: Open-Ended Questions (20-40 minutes)

**Start broad, then narrow:**

**Opening:**
"I'm looking into [general topic - workplace conduct, interactions between colleagues, etc.]. Have you observed interactions between [complainant] and [accused]?"

**If yes:** "Can you describe what you've seen or heard?"

[Let them talk uninterrupted. Don't jump in. Silence is okay.]

---

**Follow-up with specifics:**
"You mentioned [incident]. Can you walk me through exactly what happened?"

**Drill down on details:**
- "What date was this?"
- "What time of day?"
- "Where exactly were you?"
- "Who else was there?"
- "What did you see?" (If they witnessed)
- "What did you hear?" (If they overheard)
- "What was said - exact words if you remember?"
- "What was the tone of voice?"
- "How did [person] respond?"
- "What happened next?"

**For each incident, get:**
- When (date, time)
- Where (location, setting)
- Who (present, involved)
- What (exact words, actions)
- How (tone, demeanor, context)

---

**Pattern questions:**
"Have you observed this type of behavior on other occasions?"

"How many times have you seen this?"

"Was this a one-time thing or ongoing?"

---

**Impact questions:**
"Have you noticed any changes in [complainant's] demeanor or behavior?"

"Did this affect the work environment?"

"How did others react?"

---

### Phase 4: Clarifying Questions (10-20 minutes)

**Test for firsthand knowledge vs. hearsay:**

"Did you personally see this happen?"
- If YES → firsthand = strong evidence
- If NO → "Who told you about it?" → hearsay = weaker

"Were you present when this occurred?"

"Did you hear this conversation yourself, or did someone tell you about it?"

---

**Test for consistency:**

Circle back to earlier answers:
"Earlier you said [X]. Can you clarify...?"

Note: Don't aggressively challenge, but gently probe inconsistencies.

---

**Test for completeness:**

"Is there anything else about [incident] that I haven't asked?"

"Is there anything I should know that I haven't asked about?"

"Have you witnessed other interactions between them that I should know about?"

---

### Phase 5: Evidence and Other Witnesses (5 minutes)

**Documentary evidence:**
"Do you have any emails, text messages, or documents related to this?"

"Can you forward those to me / provide copies?"

"When can you get those to me?"

---

**Other witnesses:**
"Who else was present during [incident]?"

"Who else might have information about this?"

"Is there anyone else I should speak with?"

---

### Phase 6: Closing (5 minutes)

**Final opportunity:**
"Is there anything else you'd like to tell me that I haven't asked about?"

"Is there anything you want to add or clarify?"

---

**Reminder of confidentiality and no-retaliation:**
"Thank you for your time. A few final reminders:
- Please keep this conversation confidential
- Don't discuss this with [complainant], [accused], or other coworkers
- Don't retaliate or treat anyone differently because of this investigation
- If you experience any retaliation, report it immediately
- If you remember anything else after today, please contact me"

---

**Follow-up possibility:**
"I may need to follow up with you if additional questions come up or if I need clarification. Is that okay?"

---

**Questions:**
"Do you have any questions for me?"

[Answer appropriately - don't reveal other witnesses' statements or investigation details]

---

## Question Types (Do's and Don'ts)

### ✅ **DO: Use Open-Ended Questions**

**Good:**
- "Tell me what happened."
- "Describe what you saw."
- "Walk me through that day."
- "What do you remember about [incident]?"

**Why:** Lets witness tell their story without leading them

---

### ❌ **DON'T: Use Leading Questions**

**Bad:**
- "Don't you think that was inappropriate?"
- "So he made unwelcome sexual comments, right?"
- "That must have made you uncomfortable, didn't it?"

**Why:** Suggests desired answer, taints testimony

---

### ✅ **DO: Ask for Specifics**

**Good:**
- "What exactly did [person] say?"
- "Can you remember the specific words used?"
- "What date did this happen?"
- "Who else was in the room?"

**Why:** Details test credibility and provide corroboration

---

### ❌ **DON'T: Accept Vague Answers**

**Bad:**
- Witness: "He's always inappropriate."
- You: "Okay, thanks." ❌

**Good:**
- Witness: "He's always inappropriate."
- You: "Can you give me specific examples of what you mean by inappropriate?" ✅

---

### ✅ **DO: Distinguish Firsthand from Hearsay**

**Good:**
- "Did you personally witness this?"
- "Were you in the room when this was said?"
- "Did you hear the conversation yourself?"

**Why:** Firsthand knowledge is stronger evidence

---

### ❌ **DON'T: Ask Illegal Questions**

**Bad (illegal):**
- "Is [complainant] pregnant?"
- "What's [person's] sexual orientation?"
- "Does [person] have a disability?"
- "What religion are they?"

**Why:** Protected class info irrelevant unless raised by witness. Don't fish.

---

### ✅ **DO: Allow Silence**

**After asking question, be quiet. Let them think.**

People often fill silence with more information. Don't rush.

---

### ❌ **DON'T: Interrupt**

Let witness finish their thought before asking next question.

---

## Interview Best Practices

### 1. Listen More Than You Talk (80/20 Rule)

**You should be:**
- 80% listening, observing, note-taking
- 20% asking questions, clarifying

If you're talking more than the witness, you're doing it wrong.

---

### 2. Take Detailed Notes

**Capture verbatim:**
- Key quotes (exact words)
- Dates and times mentioned
- Names of people/places
- Specific incidents
- Demeanor observations (emotional, calm, hesitant, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Summarize everything (you'll forget details)
- Editorialize ("Witness seemed dishonest" - just note facts)

**Type up notes same day while memory is fresh**

---

### 3. Stay Neutral

**Your job:** Fact-finder, not judge

**Don't:**
- Show shock or disbelief ("Oh my God!")
- Express opinions ("That's terrible!")
- Take sides ("I believe you" or "That doesn't sound right")
- Make promises ("Don't worry, we'll fire them")

**Maintain neutral:**
- "Thank you for sharing that."
- "I understand."
- "Can you tell me more about that?"

---

### 4. Control the Interview

**You set the agenda:**
- Ask questions, don't let witness ramble
- Redirect if they go off-topic
- Probe inconsistencies politely
- Manage time

**But:**
- Don't be aggressive or hostile
- Allow witness to tell their story
- Don't cut them off rudely

---

### 5. Observe Demeanor (But Don't Over-Rely)

**Note:**
- Emotional (crying, angry, calm)
- Hesitant vs. confident
- Eye contact (or lack thereof)
- Body language

**BUT:**
- Demeanor is NOT determinative of credibility
- Trauma victims may appear calm or unemotional
- Cultural differences affect expression
- Use demeanor as one factor, not the factor

---

## Special Situations

### Witness is Emotional (Crying, Upset)

**Approach:**
- Offer break
- Offer tissue, water
- Express empathy: "I know this is hard. Take your time."
- Allow them to compose themselves
- Don't rush

**Don't:**
- Get emotional yourself
- Hug or touch (can be misinterpreted)
- Promise everything will be okay

---

### Witness is Hostile or Uncooperative

**Approach:**
- Stay calm and professional
- Remind of company policy requiring cooperation
- Document refusal to answer specific questions
- Note: "Witness declined to answer"

**Don't:**
- Argue or match hostility
- Threaten discipline (unless truly insubordinate)
- Give up - document what you can

**If truly insubordinate:** Discipline separately after investigation

---

### Witness Contradicts Themselves

**Approach:**
- Gently point out: "Earlier you said [X], but now you're saying [Y]. Can you help me understand?"
- Give opportunity to clarify
- Document both versions

**Don't:**
- Call them a liar
- Get aggressive
- Assume bad faith (memory is imperfect)

---

### Witness Has No Knowledge

**They say:** "I don't know anything about that" or "I didn't see anything"

**Probe a bit:**
- "Did you ever observe [general behavior]?"
- "Do you remember [date/incident]?"
- "Have you heard anything about this?"

**If genuinely no knowledge:**
- Thank them for their time
- Ask if they know who might have info
- Document: "Witness has no firsthand knowledge"
- **Still valuable** - lack of corroboration is a finding

---

### Witness Provides Hearsay

**They say:** "I heard from [person] that [accused] did [X]"

**Follow-up:**
- "You didn't personally witness this?"
- "Who told you?"
- "What exactly did they say?"
- "Do you know if [that person] personally witnessed it?"

**Then:**
- Add that person to witness list (interview them)
- Note hearsay as hearsay in your findings

---

2. "When did you learn about that?"
3. "Can you explain why you [took adverse action]?"
4. "What was the business reason for [action]?"
5. "Would you have taken the same action if [complainant] hadn't complained?"

**Witness questions:**
1. "Do you know if [complainant] filed a complaint or raised concerns?"
2. "Did [accused] know about that?"
3. "Did you observe any changes in how [complainant] was treated after that?"
4. "Did [accused] make any comments linking the complaint and the [adverse action]?"

## Credibility Assessment Factors

**When weighing witness statements, consider:**

### 1. Consistency
- Is statement internally consistent?
- Does it match previous statements?
- Does it match other evidence?

### 2. Level of Detail
- Specific (dates, times, quotes) = more credible
- Vague (general impressions) = less credible

### 3. Plausibility
- Does it make logical sense?
- Are there unexplained inconsistencies?

### 4. Corroboration
- Do other witnesses confirm?
- Does documentary evidence support?

### 5. Motive to Lie
- Does witness have personal stake?
- Relationship to parties?
- Personal grudge or gain?

### 6. Demeanor
- Note demeanor but don't over-rely
- Consider cultural differences
- Trauma affects presentation

### 7. Firsthand vs. Hearsay
- Direct observation > told by someone else
