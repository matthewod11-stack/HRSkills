### When Allegations Are Not Sustained

**Meeting in-person or video, then confirm in writing:**

```
Dear [Complainant],

Thank you for your patience during the investigation into your complaint regarding [accused].

I want to update you on the outcome. After conducting a thorough investigation that included interviewing you, [accused], and several witnesses, as well as reviewing available evidence, I have completed my review.

**Finding:**
Based on the evidence available, I was unable to substantiate the allegations. This means that, after weighing all the evidence and witness statements, I could not conclude that the alleged conduct occurred.

**Important:**
- This does NOT mean I believe you reported this in bad faith
- This does NOT mean I think you were dishonest
- This means the investigation did not produce sufficient evidence for me to reach a conclusion about what happened

Investigations sometimes result in inconclusive findings when it's one person's word against another's without corroborating evidence. This doesn't diminish the seriousness with which I took your complaint.

**If You Have Additional Information:**
If you have additional evidence or information that wasn't available during the investigation, please bring it to my attention and I can reassess.

**Your Protection:**
You remain protected from retaliation for having reported this matter. If you experience any negative treatment, please report it to me immediately.

**Going Forward:**
[If appropriate: We can discuss options such as schedule adjustments, team changes, or mediation if you believe those would be helpful in moving forward.]

Thank you for coming forward. Even when investigations don't result in sustained findings, reporting concerns is important and helps us address workplace issues.

Sincerely,
[HR Representative Name]
[Title]
[Contact Information]
