# Investigation Workflow Guide

Complete step-by-step process for conducting workplace investigations.

---

## When to Investigate

### **Always investigate (Formal investigation required):**

- **Harassment** - Sexual harassment, hostile work environment
- **Discrimination** - Based on protected class (age, race, gender, disability, etc.)
- **Retaliation** - Against someone who complained or participated in investigation
- **Violence or threats** - Physical altercations, threats of harm
- **Theft or fraud** - Misappropriation of company property or funds
- **Policy violations (serious)** - FMLA abuse, confidentiality breaches, conflicts of interest

### **Maybe investigate (Assess severity):**

- **Interpersonal conflicts** - May resolve through mediation or coaching
- **Performance issues** - Usually performance management, not investigation
- **Minor policy violations** - May address through counseling
- **Anonymous complaints** - Difficult to investigate without complainant, but still assess

### **Don't investigate (Handle differently):**

- **Legal matters already in litigation** - Refer to counsel, don't conduct internal investigation
- **Issues outside work** - Personal matters between employees outside workplace
- **Rumor or gossip** - Without specific allegations or complainant

---

## Investigation Types

### Preliminary Investigation (Assess severity)

**When:** Initial complaint, need to determine if full investigation warranted

**Process:**
1. Interview complainant (preliminary)
2. Review any immediate evidence
3. Assess credibility and severity
4. Decision: Full investigation? Alternative resolution? Close?

**Timeline:** 1-3 days

---

### Full Investigation (Formal process)

**When:** Serious allegations, legal risk, pattern of behavior

**Process:**
1. Investigation plan
2. Evidence collection
3. Multiple interviews (complainant, accused, witnesses)
4. Analysis and findings
5. Report and recommendations

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

---

### External Investigation (Third-party investigator)

**When:**
- Accusation against executive or senior leader
- Internal conflict of interest
- Company lacks investigation expertise
- High legal risk (discrimination, class action potential)

**Who:** Employment attorney or professional investigator

**Cost:** $5,000-$50,000+ depending on complexity

---

## Investigation Workflow (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Intake and Initial Assessment (Day 1)

#### Step 1: Receive Complaint

**How complaints come in:**
- Direct report to HR
- Report to manager (manager must escalate to HR)
- Hotline or anonymous tip
- Witnessed by manager or HR

**Immediate documentation:**
- Date and time of report
- Who reported (complainant or third party)
- Brief summary of allegation
- Initial contact information

---

#### Step 2: Acknowledge Receipt

**Within 24 hours:**
- Acknowledge you received the complaint
- Thank them for coming forward
- Explain general process (confidential, thorough, no retaliation)
- Set expectations for timeline

**Sample acknowledgment:**
```
"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I want you to know that I take this seriously and will look into it thoroughly. I'll keep you updated on progress, though I can't share all details due to confidentiality. You have my commitment that we don't tolerate [issue], and there will be no retaliation for reporting this. I'll be in touch within the next few days to discuss next steps."
```

---

#### Step 3: Document the Complaint

**Create case file:**
- Case ID: [ER-YYYY-###]
- Date received
- Complainant information
- Accused information
- Allegation summary (verbatim if possible)
- Initial severity assessment

**File storage:**
- Secure location (not in personnel files)
- Restricted access (HR, legal, investigator only)
- Separate from performance reviews

---

#### Step 4: Assess Severity and Urgency

**Severity matrix:**

| Severity | Examples | Timeline | Action |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Threats, violence, ongoing abuse, quid pro quo | Same day | Immediate separation, full investigation, legal counsel |
| **High** | Discrimination, retaliation, pattern of harassment | 24-48 hours | Full investigation, interim measures, legal review |
| **Medium** | Policy violations, one-time harassment claim, hostile comments | 1 week | Investigation or alternative resolution |
| **Low** | Interpersonal conflict, minor misunderstanding | 2 weeks | Mediation, coaching, or close |

---

#### Step 5: Immediate Safety Measures

**If there's safety risk:**
- Separate parties immediately (different shifts, departments, no-contact order)
- Paid administrative leave for accused (not punishment, interim measure)
- Security involvement if threats of violence
- Employee assistance program (EAP) for complainant

**Document all interim measures**

---

#### Step 6: Notify Key Stakeholders

**Who needs to know (immediately):**
- HR Director/CHRO
- Legal counsel (if high risk)
- Accused's manager (general terms, not detailed complaint)

**Who does NOT need to know:**
- Other employees (confidential)
- Accused's coworkers (unless they're witnesses)

---

### Phase 2: Investigation Planning (Days 2-3)

#### Step 7: Assign Investigator

**Options:**
- **Internal HR:** For lower-risk cases, experienced HR professional
- **Legal counsel:** For high-risk cases (discrimination, executive involved)
- **External investigator:** For conflicts of interest or specialized expertise

**Investigator must be:**
- Neutral (no bias toward complainant or accused)
- Trained in investigations
- Knowledgeable about legal requirements

---

#### Step 8: Develop Investigation Plan

**Plan includes:**
- Scope (what are we investigating?)
- Timeline (target completion date)
- Parties to interview (complainant, accused, witnesses)
- Evidence to collect (emails, documents, records)
- Legal compliance requirements

**Template:** See SKILL.md for investigation plan template

---

#### Step 9: Legal Review (If Needed)

**When to involve legal counsel:**
- Protected class discrimination alleged
- Retaliation claim
- Pattern of complaints
- Senior executive involved
- High potential for lawsuit

**What legal reviews:**
- Investigation plan and scope
- Interview questions (avoid illegal questions)
- Interim measures (lawful separation, leave)
- Compliance with state/federal law

---

### Phase 3: Evidence Collection (Days 3-5)

#### Step 10: Collect Documentary Evidence

**Sources:**
- Email communications
- Slack/Teams messages
- Text messages (if provided by parties)
- Performance reviews and HR file notes
- Prior complaints
- Company policies allegedly violated
- Calendar invites, expense reports, travel records
- Security footage (if applicable)
- Social media (if work-related)

**How to request:**
- IT department (email, Slack with proper authorization)
- Employees (ask them to provide copies)
- HR files (review all relevant documents)

**Chain of custody:**
- Document when and how evidence was obtained
- Make copies, preserve originals
- Organize chronologically

---

#### Step 11: Identify Witnesses

**Who are potential witnesses?**
- Named by complainant ("These people saw it")
- Named by accused (in their interview)
- Coworkers present during alleged incidents
- Managers or supervisors with knowledge
- Anyone who observed relevant behavior

**Prioritize:**
- Direct witnesses (firsthand knowledge) over hearsay
- Neutral parties over friends of complainant/accused

---

### Phase 4: Interviews (Days 5-15)

#### Step 12: Interview Complainant

**Order:** Always interview complainant first

**Purpose:**
- Get detailed account of allegations
- Understand timeline and specific incidents
- Identify witnesses and evidence
- Assess credibility
- Determine impact

**See:** Witness interview guide for detailed questions

**Duration:** 1-2 hours

**Best practices:**
- Two interviewers (questioner + note-taker)
- Private location
- Allow time for emotional processing
- Don't rush
- Get specifics (dates, times, quotes, locations)

---

#### Step 13: Interview Witnesses

**Order:** Interview witnesses before accused

**Why:** Get independent accounts before accused knows details and can coordinate stories

**For each witness:**
- Schedule separately (no group interviews)
- Confidentiality reminder
- Open-ended questions
- Document verbatim key statements
- No leading questions

**Red flags:**
- Witness refuses to participate (document refusal)
- Witness appears coached (note observations)
- Conflicting accounts (investigate further)

---

#### Step 14: Interview Accused

**Order:** Interview accused last (after witnesses)

**Why:**
- Due process - they have right to respond
- Confrontation - see their reaction to specific allegations
- Gather their evidence and witnesses

**Notice to accused:**
Provide general description of allegations, not verbatim complaint:

```
"We've received a complaint regarding your conduct in the workplace. Specifically, concerns about [general category: comments made, interactions with colleagues, policy compliance, etc.]. I'd like to meet with you to discuss this and hear your perspective. This is not a conclusion that anything happened, but an opportunity for you to share your side."
```

**During interview:**
- Present specific allegations
- Ask for their account
- Listen to their defenses
- Identify their witnesses
- Collect their evidence

**Do NOT:**
- Share complainant's name if safety risk
- Promise outcomes
- Debate or argue

---

#### Step 15: Follow-Up Interviews (If Needed)

**When follow-up needed:**
- Conflicting accounts (need clarification)
- New witnesses identified
- New evidence surfaces
- Complainant/accused want to add information

**Allow parties to review and correct:**
- Let them review your notes (optional, not required)
- Opportunity to clarify or add info

---

### Phase 5: Analysis and Findings (Days 16-20)

#### Step 16: Organize Evidence

**Create timeline:**
- Chronological list of all alleged events
- Map witness accounts to each event
- Note corroboration or conflicts

**Evidence summary:**
- Documentary evidence supporting/refuting each allegation
- Witness statements by person
- Credibility assessments

---

#### Step 17: Assess Credibility

**Factors to consider:**

**Consistency:**
- Are statements consistent internally?
- Do they match other evidence?
- Did story change over time?

**Detail:**
- Specific details (dates, times, quotes) more credible
- Vague generalities less credible

**Corroboration:**
- Do other witnesses support this account?
- Does documentary evidence align?

**Plausibility:**
- Does this make sense given circumstances?
- Are there logical inconsistencies?

**Demeanor:**
- Note demeanor but don't rely solely on it
- Trauma can affect demeanor
- Cultural differences in expression

**Motive:**
- Does person have reason to lie?
- Personal gain? Revenge? Protection?

**Bias:**
- Are they friends with one party?
- Do they have stake in outcome?

---

#### Step 18: Apply Legal Standards

**Standard of proof:**
"Preponderance of evidence" = More likely than not (51%+)

**NOT:**
- "Beyond reasonable doubt" (criminal standard)
- "Clear and convincing" (higher civil standard)

**Question:** Based on all evidence, is it more likely than not that the alleged conduct occurred?

---

#### Step 19: Determine Findings

**For each allegation:**

**Sustained:** Evidence supports that it occurred
- Complainant credible
- Corroborating evidence
- Accused's denial not credible or admits to conduct
- **Conclusion:** Allegation is substantiated

**Not Sustained:** Evidence does not support that it occurred
- Complainant not credible or inconsistent
- No corroborating evidence
- Accused credible and has evidence refuting
- **Conclusion:** Allegation is not substantiated

**Inconclusive:** Insufficient evidence to determine
- He said / she said with no witnesses
- No corroborating evidence either way
- Both parties credible
- **Conclusion:** Cannot determine what happened

**Note:** "Not sustained" ≠ "complainant lied." It means insufficient evidence to conclude it happened.

---

#### Step 20: Draft Investigation Report

**Report includes:**
- Executive summary
- Allegations
- Investigation methodology
- Interviews conducted
- Evidence reviewed
- Findings (by allegation)
- Credibility assessments
- Overall conclusions
- Policy violations identified
- Recommended corrective action

**See:** SKILL.md for complete report template

---

### Phase 6: Resolution and Corrective Action (Days 21-25)

#### Step 21: Legal Review of Findings (If Applicable)

**Before finalizing:**
- Legal counsel reviews findings and recommendations
- Ensures compliance with law
- Identifies any legal risks
- Advises on discipline

---

#### Step 22: Determine Corrective Action

**If allegations sustained, consider:**

**Factors for discipline:**
- Severity of violation (minor comment vs. assault)
- Pattern vs. isolated incident
- Impact on victim
- Position of accused (higher level = higher accountability)
- Company policy requirements
- Past discipline for similar conduct (consistency)
- Legal requirements (effective remedial action)

**Discipline range:**

| Violation | Typical Discipline |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Minor inappropriate comment (first time) | Verbal warning, training |
| Pattern of comments or hostile environment | Written warning, mandatory training |
| Severe harassment or discrimination | Suspension, final warning, or termination |
| Physical contact, threats, quid pro quo | Termination |

**Document rationale for chosen discipline**

---

#### Step 23: Communicate Findings

**To complainant:**
```
"Thank you for your patience during this investigation. I want to update you on the outcome. After a thorough investigation that included interviewing you, [accused], and several witnesses, as well as reviewing relevant documents, I've completed my review.

[If sustained:]
"I found that [general description without details]. This violated our [policy]. I've taken appropriate action to address this and ensure it doesn't happen again. Due to confidentiality, I can't share specifics about the action taken, but please know it was taken seriously.

[If not sustained:]
"Based on the evidence available, I was unable to substantiate the allegations. This doesn't mean I don't believe you came forward in good faith. It means the evidence didn't allow me to reach a conclusion one way or another. If you have additional information, please let me know."

In either case:
"I want to remind you that retaliation is prohibited. If you experience any retaliation for reporting this, please let me know immediately. I'll be checking in with you in 30 days to make sure everything is okay. Do you have any questions?"
```

**Do NOT:**
- Share details of discipline given to accused
- Promise specific discipline
- Disparage accused

---

**To accused:**

```
[If allegations sustained:]
"Thank you for your cooperation during this investigation. After a thorough review, including interviewing you and others with relevant information, I've concluded that [violation occurred].

This violated our policy on [harassment/discrimination/conduct/etc.]. As a result, [discipline - verbal warning / written warning / suspension / termination].

Going forward, you are expected to [specific behavioral expectations]. You must complete [training] by [date]. Your conduct will be monitored, and any further violations will result in [escalated discipline, up to and including termination].

You may not retaliate against anyone who participated in this investigation. Retaliation will result in immediate termination.

Do you understand these expectations?"

[Document their acknowledgment]

[If allegations not sustained:]
"Thank you for your cooperation during this investigation. After thorough review, I did not find sufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. However, I want to remind you of our expectations regarding [respectful workplace/professionalism/etc.]. Going forward, be mindful of [specific areas]. Do you have any questions?"
```

---

#### Step 24: Implement Corrective Action

**Actions to take:**

**Discipline:**
- Issue written warning (in personnel file)
- Conduct suspension (if applicable)
- Process termination (if applicable)

**Training:**
- Schedule harassment prevention training
- Respectful workplace training
- Manager coaching (if applicable)

**Monitoring:**
- Manager to monitor conduct for 90 days
- HR check-ins at 30, 60, 90 days

**Policy/systemic changes:**
- Update policies if needed
- Department-wide training
- Structural changes (reporting lines, etc.)

---

#### Step 25: Follow-Up

**30-day check-in:**
- Meet with complainant: Any retaliation? How are things?
- Meet with accused: Compliance with expectations?
- Meet with manager: Observations?

**90-day review:**
- Assess effectiveness of corrective action
- Any recurring issues?
- Document results
- Close case if resolved

**File retention:**
- Keep investigation file for 5+ years
- Separate from personnel files
- Restricted access

---

## Special Situations

### Anonymous Complaints

**Challenges:**
- Can't interview complainant
- Difficult to get specifics
- Credibility unknown

**Approach:**
1. Assess credibility of complaint (specific or vague?)
2. Investigate if possible (interview witnesses, review evidence)
3. If no investigation possible, document why
4. Monitor situation for further complaints

**Cannot ignore anonymous complaints about serious matters (harassment, discrimination)**

---

### Complaint Against CEO or Senior Executive

**Challenges:**
- Internal investigator reports to accused
- Perceived bias
- High legal risk

**Approach:**
- **Use external investigator** (attorney or professional)
- Report to board, not accused
- Extra care with confidentiality

**Do NOT:**
- Let accused influence investigation
- Let friendship or loyalty affect objectivity
- Delay due to discomfort

---

### Complainant Recants or Withdraws Complaint

**Don't automatically close:**
- Complainant may feel pressured
- Fear of retaliation
- Employer still has obligation to investigate serious matters

**Approach:**
1. Ask why they're withdrawing (document answer)
2. Remind of no-retaliation protections
3. Assess if complaint suggests pattern or serious misconduct
4. If serious, continue investigation even if complainant won't participate

---

### Both Parties Violated Policies

**Example:**
- Complainant reports harassment
- Investigation reveals complainant also engaged in misconduct

**Approach:**
- Investigate both sets of allegations
- Each party's misconduct is evaluated separately
- Both can be disciplined if warranted
- Complaint doesn't give complainant immunity from their own violations

---

### Inconclusive Findings

**When to use:**
- He said / she said, no witnesses
- Both parties equally credible
- No documentary evidence
- Insufficient evidence to reach conclusion

**Don't default to "inconclusive" to avoid tough decisions**

**After inconclusive finding:**
- May still provide training or coaching
- Monitor situation
- Document for pattern purposes
- Remind parties of expectations

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Delaying Investigation

**Problem:** Memories fade, evidence disappears, situations escalate

**Fix:** Begin within 24-48 hours

---

### Mistake 2: Inadequate Documentation

**Problem:** Can't defend findings without contemporaneous notes

**Fix:** Document everything in real-time

---

### Mistake 3: Bias or Predetermined Conclusions

**Problem:** "I know this person would never do that"

**Fix:** Approach objectively, follow evidence

---

### Mistake 4: Only Interviewing One Side

**Problem:** Failure to give accused opportunity to respond = due process violation

**Fix:** Always interview accused and their witnesses

---

### Mistake 5: Promising Specific Outcomes

**Problem:** "Don't worry, we'll fire them"

**Fix:** Commit to thorough investigation, not specific result

---

### Mistake 6: Sharing Too Much Information

**Problem:** Telling complainant details of accused's discipline

**Fix:** General outcome only, not specifics

---

### Mistake 7: Ignoring Credibility Issues

**Problem:** Believing one party simply because you like them

**Fix:** Assess credibility objectively based on evidence

---

### Mistake 8: No Follow-Up

**Problem:** Investigation closes, no monitoring for retaliation or recurrence

**Fix:** 30-day and 90-day follow-ups

---

## Legal Compliance Checklist

**Before closing investigation, confirm:**

- [ ] Prompt investigation (started within days of complaint)
- [ ] Thorough (all relevant witnesses interviewed)
- [ ] Objective (neutral investigator)
- [ ] Fair (accused had opportunity to respond)
- [ ] Documented (contemporaneous notes, report)
- [ ] Appropriate remedial action taken (if allegations sustained)
- [ ] No retaliation occurred
- [ ] Follow-up conducted

**Failure on any of these = legal liability**

---

## Investigation Timeline (Standard)

**Day 1:** Complaint received, acknowledged, initial assessment

**Days 2-3:** Investigation plan, evidence collection begins

**Days 3-7:** Interview complainant

**Days 5-12:** Interview witnesses

**Days 12-15:** Interview accused

**Days 15-18:** Follow-up interviews if needed

**Days 18-22:** Analysis, findings, report drafted

**Days 22-25:** Legal review, finalize report, determine discipline

**Day 25:** Communicate findings to parties

**Day 30+:** Implement corrective action, follow-up

**Total:** 2-4 weeks typical for most investigations

---

## Key Principles

1. **Promptness** - Start immediately, complete within 2-4 weeks
2. **Thoroughness** - Interview everyone, review everything
3. **Objectivity** - No bias, follow evidence
4. **Fairness** - Both sides heard, due process
5. **Confidentiality** - Need-to-know only
6. **Documentation** - Contemporaneous notes, formal report
7. **Consistency** - Same process, same standards
8. **Follow-through** - Corrective action + monitoring

Good investigations protect employees AND the company. Done right, they build trust, resolve issues, and prevent legal liability.
