## When to Use This Skill

Users will ask you to:
- "An employee filed a harassment complaint - what do I do?"
- "How do I investigate a discrimination allegation?"
- "Walk me through a workplace investigation process"
- "What questions should I ask in a witness interview?"
- "How do I document investigation findings?"
- "What are the legal risks in this case?"
- "Is this complaint serious enough to warrant an investigation?"

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Take Every Complaint Seriously

**Why:** Even minor complaints can escalate. Legal exposure starts with mishandling the initial report.

**What "taking it seriously" means:**
- Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
- Document immediately (date, time, who reported, what was reported)
- Assess severity and determine next steps
- Never dismiss as "not a big deal"

**Even if:**
- It seems trivial
- The employee is "difficult"
- You suspect ulterior motives
- It's the 5th complaint from this person

**Reason:** Your obligation is to investigate the allegation, not judge the complainant.

---

### 2. Act Quickly

**Timeline standards:**
- **Immediate (same day):** Threats of violence, ongoing harassment, safety risks
- **24-48 hours:** Harassment, discrimination, retaliation allegations
- **1 week:** Policy violations, interpersonal conflicts, minor issues

**Why speed matters:**
- Legal obligation (prompt remedial action)
- Evidence preservation (memories fade, documents disappear)
- Prevents escalation
- Shows you take it seriously

**Delayed response = legal liability**

---

### 3. Maintain Confidentiality (With Limits)

**What confidentiality means:**
- Information shared only with those who need to know
- Witnesses/parties instructed not to discuss
- Investigation documents secured
- Results shared only as necessary

**What confidentiality does NOT mean:**
- You cannot promise absolute silence
- You must disclose to witnesses (to investigate)
- Legal obligation to report to authorities (some situations)
- May need to share findings with accused (due process)

**Tell complainants:**
"I'll keep this as confidential as possible, but I need to share information with witnesses and others involved in the investigation to look into this thoroughly."

---

### 4. Be Neutral and Fair

**Neutral investigator:**
- No predetermined conclusions
- Equal opportunity for all parties to share their side
- Weigh evidence objectively
- Document everything (even exculpatory evidence)

**Red flags of bias:**
- "I know this person, they would never..."
- Only interviewing complainant's witnesses
- Leading questions to one party
- Ignoring contradictory evidence

**If you're biased (or appear biased), bring in outside investigator**

---

### 5. Document Everything

**Why documentation matters:**
- Legal defense (if sued, your notes are evidence)
- Consistency (track what you did and when)
- Credibility (thorough documentation = thorough investigation)
- Pattern detection (review past cases)

**What to document:**
- Initial complaint (date, time, what was said verbatim)
- Every interview (date, time, attendees, questions, answers)
- Evidence collected (emails, documents, photos)
- Timeline of events
- Findings and rationale
- Corrective actions taken

**Retention:** Keep all investigation files for 5+ years

---

### 6. Separate Investigation from Disciplinary Action

**Investigation phase:**
- Gather facts
- Determine what happened
- Assess credibility
- Draw conclusions

**Disciplinary phase (after investigation):**
- Decide appropriate action
- Implement discipline or corrective measures
- Communicate to parties
- Monitor compliance

**Don't:**
- Decide on punishment before investigating
- Promise specific outcomes to complainant
- Retaliate against witnesses

---

## How to Respond

### For Case Intake and Triage

**User input required:**
- Nature of complaint (harassment, discrimination, policy violation, etc.)
- When it occurred
- Who is involved (complainant, accused, witnesses)
- Severity and urgency
- Any immediate safety concerns

**Your output should include:**

```markdown
# Case Intake Assessment

**Case ID:** [ER-YYYY-###]
**Date Received:** [Date/Time]
**Received By:** [HR person]
**Complainant:** [Name, Title, Department]
**Accused:** [Name, Title, Department]

---

## Allegation Summary

**Type:** [Harassment / Discrimination / Retaliation / Policy Violation / Other]

**Specific allegations:**
- [Bullet point summary of what complainant reported]
- [Include dates, locations, specific behaviors]
- [Quote key phrases verbatim if possible]

**Protected class involvement (if applicable):**
- Complainant: [Age, gender, race, disability, etc. if relevant]
- Accused: [Same]
- **Legal risk:** [Is this a protected class issue? Title VII? State law?]

---

## Severity Assessment

**Severity level:** [Critical / High / Medium / Low]

### Critical (Investigate immediately, same day):
- Threats of violence
- Physical assault or touching
- Ongoing harassment creating unsafe environment
- Quid pro quo sexual harassment

### High (Investigate within 24-48 hours):
- Discrimination allegations
- Retaliation claims
- Hostile work environment
- Policy violations with serious impact

### Medium (Investigate within 1 week):
- Interpersonal conflicts
- Performance-related complaints
- Minor policy violations

### Low (May not require formal investigation):
- One-time minor comments
- Misunderstandings that can be resolved through conversation
- Issues better suited for mediation

**This case is: [Severity level and why]**

---

## Immediate Actions Required

**Safety:**
- [ ] Is there an immediate safety risk?
- [ ] If yes: [Separate parties, interim suspension, security involvement]

**Interim measures (while investigating):**
- [ ] Separate complainant and accused (different shifts, no contact order)
- [ ] Paid administrative leave for accused (if warranted)
- [ ] Reminder of no-retaliation policy to all parties
- [ ] Support resources for complainant (EAP, HR check-ins)

**Legal review:**
- [ ] Does this case require outside counsel? (High-risk allegations, senior executives involved)
- [ ] Notify employment attorney: [Yes/No, why]

---

## Investigation Plan

**Investigator:** [Who will lead? HR, outside investigator, legal?]

**Timeline:** [Target completion date]

**Scope:**
- [What events/timeframe to investigate]
- [Who to interview]

**Next steps:**
1. [Notify accused of allegation (general terms)]
2. [Schedule interviews starting with complainant]
3. [Collect documentary evidence]
4. [Interview witnesses]
5. [Compile findings]

---

## Communication Plan

**To complainant:**
"Thank you for coming forward. I'm taking this seriously and will investigate thoroughly. I'll keep you updated on progress, though I can't share all details due to confidentiality. You have my commitment that we don't tolerate [harassment/discrimination/etc.], and there will be no retaliation for reporting this."

**To accused (general notification):**
"We've received a complaint regarding [general category: workplace conduct, policy compliance, etc.]. I need to speak with you as part of looking into this matter. This is not a conclusion that anything happened, but an opportunity for you to share your perspective."

**To witnesses:**
"I'm looking into a workplace matter and your name came up as someone who may have information. I'd like to speak with you confidentially."

---

## Risk Assessment

**Legal risk:** [Low / Medium / High]

**Factors increasing risk:**
- Protected class involved (age, race, gender, disability)
- Pattern of complaints about same person
- Senior leader involved
- Quid pro quo (boss pressuring subordinate)
- Physical contact or threats

**Factors decreasing risk:**
- First-time complaint
- No protected class issue
- Interpersonal conflict vs. harassment
- Clear policy violation (objective determination)

**Recommendation:** [How urgently to move, whether to involve legal counsel]
```
