## Core Concepts

### The Annual Compensation Review Cycle

Most companies conduct compensation reviews once or twice per year, typically aligned with:
- **Performance review cycle** (annual reviews in Q4/Q1)
- **Fiscal year start** (budget planning)
- **Calendar year** (January effective dates)

**Typical Timeline:**

| Month | Activity | Owner |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Aug-Sep | Plan budget, review market data | Finance, HR |
| Oct | Finalize comp philosophy and merit matrix | Leadership |
| Nov | Managers submit recommendations | Managers |
| Dec | Calibration, approval, finalize decisions | HR, Leadership |
| Jan | Communicate changes to employees | Managers |
| Feb | Effective date of new compensation | Payroll |

---

## Step 1: Set the Compensation Budget

### Budget Components

**Total Compensation Budget = Merit Increases + Promotions + Equity Refresh + Market Adjustments**

**Typical budget ranges:**
- **Conservative:** 2-3% of total payroll
- **Moderate:** 3-4% of total payroll
- **Competitive:** 4-5% of total payroll
- **Aggressive:** 5-7% of total payroll (high-growth startups, tight labor market)

**Breakdown Example (4% total budget):**
- Merit increases: 3% of payroll
- Promotions: 0.5% of payroll
- Market adjustments: 0.3% of payroll
- Equity refresh: 0.2% of payroll

---

### Budget Allocation Methods

#### Option 1: Equal Distribution
Everyone gets the same percentage raise (e.g., 3% across the board).

**Pros:** Simple, perceived as fair
**Cons:** Doesn't differentiate performance, top performers may leave

**Use when:** Small company (<20 people), financial constraints, egalitarian culture

---

#### Option 2: Performance-Based (Merit Matrix)
Raises vary based on performance rating and position in pay range.

**Pros:** Rewards high performers, retains top talent, fiscally responsible
**Cons:** More complex, requires strong performance management

**Use when:** Most companies (50+ employees), mature performance system

---

#### Option 3: Promotion-Only
No across-the-board raises, only promotions get increases.

**Pros:** Focuses budget on impact
**Cons:** Demotivating for non-promoted employees

**Use when:** Severe budget constraints, restructuring

---

#### Option 4: Market-Driven
Raises determined by market competitiveness, not performance.

**Pros:** Addresses retention risk, market-competitive
**Cons:** Ignores performance, expensive

**Use when:** High attrition, talent war, underpaid workforce

---

## Step 2: Design the Merit Matrix

A **merit matrix** maps performance ratings and compa-ratio to recommended raise percentages.

### What is Compa-Ratio?

**Compa-Ratio = Employee Salary / Midpoint of Pay Range**

- **< 0.80:** Well below market (needs large adjustment)
- **0.80-0.90:** Below midpoint (room for growth)
- **0.90-1.10:** At midpoint (market rate)
- **1.10-1.20:** Above midpoint (experienced/high performer)
- **> 1.20:** At or above max (limited room for raises)

---

### Merit Matrix Example (3% average budget)

| Performance | Compa-Ratio 0.80-0.90 | Compa-Ratio 0.90-1.00 | Compa-Ratio 1.00-1.10 | Compa-Ratio 1.10-1.20 | Compa-Ratio >1.20 |
|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Exceeds Expectations** | 5-6% | 4-5% | 4% | 3% | 2% or 0% |
| **Meets Expectations** | 4-5% | 3-4% | 3% | 2% | 0-1% |
| **Needs Improvement** | 2-3% | 2% | 1% | 0% | 0% |
| **Does Not Meet** | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% (PIP or exit) |

**Interpretation:**
- High performers + low in range = largest raises (5-6%)
- High performers + high in range = smaller raises (2-3%) - already well-paid
- Low performers = minimal or no raise
- Compa-ratio >1.20 = limited raises (already paid above midpoint)

---

### Alternative: Forced Ranking Distribution

Some companies cap the % of employees who can receive top raises:

**Example Distribution:**
- Top 10%: 6-8% raises
- Next 20%: 4-5% raises
- Middle 50%: 2-3% raises
- Bottom 20%: 0-2% raises or PIP

**Pros:** Forces differentiation, protects budget
**Cons:** Demotivating, can feel arbitrary

**Use when:** Large companies (500+), clear performance tiers

---

## Step 3: Handle Promotions

Promotions require larger salary increases than merit raises.

### Promotion Increase Guidelines

**Typical promotion increases:**
- **10-15%:** Standard promotion (e.g., Senior Engineer → Staff Engineer)
- **15-20%:** Large jump (e.g., IC → Manager)
- **20-30%:** Major level jump (e.g., Manager → Director)

**But also consider:**
- **Current salary vs. new pay range:** If employee is already at 90% of new range midpoint, increase may be smaller
- **Market rate:** Ensure new salary is competitive for the role
- **Internal equity:** Compare to peers at the same level

**Formula:**
```
Promotion Increase = Max(
  Minimum increase to reach new range minimum + 10%,
  10-15% of current salary,
  Competitive market rate for new role
)
```

---

### Example: Promotion Calculation

**Employee:** Jane Doe, Senior Software Engineer
- Current salary: $140,000
- Performance: Exceeds Expectations
- Promotion: Staff Software Engineer

**Staff Engineer Pay Range:**
- Min: $150,000
- Midpoint: $180,000
- Max: $210,000

**Calculation:**
1. Minimum to enter range: $150,000 (but this is only 7% increase - too low)
2. Standard 15% promotion increase: $140,000 × 1.15 = $161,000
3. Target compa-ratio for new hire: 0.90 (90% of midpoint) = $162,000

**Recommendation:** $162,000 (15.7% increase)
- Places Jane at 0.90 compa-ratio in new range (room to grow)
- Competitive for Staff Engineer market rate
- Recognizes promotion and strong performance

---

## Step 4: Equity Refresh Grants

For companies that grant stock options, RSUs, or equity, the **equity refresh** replenishes employee equity.

### Why Equity Refreshes Matter

- Initial equity grants vest over 4 years
- After Year 2, vesting acceleration slows (cliff effect)
- Employees lose motivation if no new grants
- Competitors offer new equity to poach talent

### Equity Refresh Strategy

**Annual refresh grants (typical):**
- **Top 10% performers:** 0.05-0.10% of company equity
- **Strong performers:** 0.02-0.05%
- **Meets expectations:** 0.01-0.02%
- **Underperformers:** 0% (no refresh)

**OR percentage of salary (RSUs):**
- **Top performers:** 25-50% of salary in RSUs
- **Strong performers:** 15-25% of salary
- **Solid performers:** 5-15% of salary

**Vesting:** 4-year vest with 1-year cliff (standard)

---

### Equity Refresh Example

**Employee:** John Smith, Product Manager
- Salary: $160,000
- Performance: Strong performer
- Original grant: 20,000 options (4-year vest), granted 2 years ago
  - Vested so far: 10,000 options
  - Remaining: 10,000 options (vest over next 2 years)

**Refresh Grant:** 8,000 options (0.04% of company)
- Vesting: 4 years (2,000/year)
- **Effect:** Smooths vesting cliff, maintains ~5,000 options vesting per year

---

## Step 5: Market Adjustments

**Market adjustments** correct pay for employees who are below market rate (not due to performance, but due to market shifts or pay compression).

### When to Use Market Adjustments

- **Pay compression:** Long-tenured employees paid less than new hires in same role
- **Market rate increases:** Role's market rate increased 15%+ since last comp review
- **Retention risk:** Competitor offers / employee interviewing
- **Pay equity:** Gender/race pay gaps identified in audit

### Market Adjustment Process

1. **Benchmark roles:** Use salary surveys (Radford, Mercer, Pave, Carta) to determine market rate
2. **Identify gaps:** Compare employee salaries to market P50 (median) or P75 (75th percentile)
3. **Prioritize:** Focus on largest gaps, high-performers, retention risks
4. **Budget:** Allocate 0.3-0.5% of payroll for market adjustments
5. **Execute:** Apply adjustments outside the normal merit cycle (can be mid-year)

---

### Market Adjustment Example

**Employee:** Maria Garcia, Senior Designer
- Current salary: $95,000
- Performance: Exceeds Expectations
- Market rate (P50): $115,000
- Gap: $20,000 (17% below market)

**Recommendation:** Market adjustment of $15,000 → New salary: $110,000
- Brings Maria to 96% of market rate
- Avoids overpaying (still room for merit raises)
- Addresses retention risk

**Timing:** Effective immediately (mid-year adjustment, not annual review)

---

## Step 6: Calibration & Approval

Before finalizing compensation decisions, calibrate across teams to ensure fairness.

### Calibration Meeting Process

**Attendees:** Department heads, HR, Finance, CEO (for senior roles)

**Agenda:**
1. Review merit matrix and guidelines
2. Each manager presents their team's proposed raises
3. Compare raises across teams (ensure consistency)
4. Challenge outliers:
   - "Why is Employee X getting 7% when their peer got 3%?"
   - "This team averaged 4.5% raises, but that team averaged 2.8%. Why?"
5. Identify budget over/under allocations
6. Adjust recommendations to fit total budget

**Red Flags to Investigate:**
- Manager giving everyone 5%+ (grade inflation)
- Manager giving everyone <2% (too conservative or poor performance)
- Large variance within same role/performance tier
- Demographic patterns (e.g., women averaging 2.5%, men averaging 3.5%)

---

### Budget Reconciliation

**If over budget:**
- Trim high compa-ratio employees (>1.10) by 0.5-1%
- Reduce "Meets Expectations" raises by 0.5%
- Defer some market adjustments to mid-year

**If under budget:**
- Increase "Exceeds" raises by 0.5-1%
- Add more market adjustments
- Create retention bonuses for critical roles
- Bank savings for mid-year adjustments

---

## Step 7: Communicate Compensation Changes

**Managers deliver compensation decisions in 1:1 meetings.**

### Manager Talking Points (Template)

**Opening:**
> "I want to share your compensation changes for [year]. I've been working with HR on our annual review process, and I'm excited to talk through your new compensation."

**Salary Increase:**
> "Your new salary will be [new salary], which is a [X%] increase from your current salary of [old salary]. This is effective [date]."
>
> "This increase reflects [your strong performance this year / your promotion to Senior Engineer / a market adjustment to ensure we're competitive]."

**If above-average raise:**
> "I want to highlight that your [X%] increase is above our company average of [Y%]. This reflects your exceptional performance on [Project A] and [Impact B]. Thank you for your contributions."

**If average raise:**
> "Your increase is in line with our merit guidelines for [Meets Expectations / Solid Contributor] performance. I appreciate your work on [specific example], and I see opportunities for you to grow in [area] next year."

**If no raise or below-average:**
> "I know this isn't the increase you were hoping for. Based on our performance conversations this year, we identified [specific performance gap]. I'm committed to supporting you through [action plan], and we'll reassess compensation at [next review cycle or mid-year check-in]."

**Equity (if applicable):**
> "You're also receiving a refresh grant of [X options / RSUs] vesting over 4 years. This is [above/in line with/below] our standard refresh for [performance tier]."

**Closing:**
> "Do you have any questions about your compensation or the review process?"

---

### What NOT to Say

❌ "This is all we could afford."
❌ "Everyone got the same raise."
❌ "HR wouldn't approve more."
❌ "I fought for you but lost."
❌ "You should be grateful."

✅ Instead: Focus on performance, market, and what employee can do to earn more next cycle.

---

## Step 8: Pay Equity Audit

**Legally required in some states (e.g., California SB 1162, Colorado Equal Pay Act).**

### Pay Equity Analysis Process

1. **Segment employees:** Group by role, level, location
2. **Run regression analysis:** Control for:
   - Performance rating
   - Tenure
   - Education
   - Prior experience
   - Manager
3. **Identify unexplained gaps:** Pay differences NOT explained by legitimate factors
4. **Test for statistical significance:** Use 95% confidence interval
5. **Remediate gaps:** Adjust salaries to close unexplained gaps (prioritize gender/race)

---

### Example: Pay Equity Audit

**Role:** Software Engineer II

| Employee | Gender | Salary | Performance | Tenure | Expected Salary | Gap |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|-----|
| Alice | F | $115,000 | Exceeds | 3 yrs | $120,000 | -$5,000 |
| Bob | M | $125,000 | Exceeds | 3 yrs | $120,000 | +$5,000 |
| Carlos | M | $118,000 | Meets | 2 yrs | $115,000 | +$3,000 |
| Dana | F | $110,000 | Meets | 2 yrs | $115,000 | -$5,000 |

**Finding:** Female engineers paid $5,000 less on average, even after controlling for performance and tenure.

**Remediation:**
- Alice: +$5,000 market adjustment → $120,000
- Dana: +$5,000 market adjustment → $115,000
- Total cost: $10,000

**Legal risk if NOT fixed:** Potential class-action lawsuit under Equal Pay Act.

## Compensation Philosophy Framework

Define your company's compensation strategy before the review cycle.

### Key Decisions:

#### 1. Market Positioning
Where do you target compensation relative to market?

- **Below Market (P25-P40):** Cost-conscious, trades comp for mission/culture
- **At Market (P50):** Competitive, balanced approach
- **Above Market (P65-P75):** Premium pay, attracts top talent
- **Top of Market (P90+):** Talent war, high-growth startups

**Example Philosophy:**
> "We target P60 (60th percentile) for base salary and P75 for total compensation (including equity) for all roles. We pay at P75+ for critical hard-to-fill roles (ML engineers, senior designers)."

---

#### 2. Internal Equity vs. External Competitiveness

**Internal Equity:** Pay people consistently for similar roles/performance
**External Competitiveness:** Pay market rate to attract/retain talent

**Trade-off:**
- Strict internal equity can underpay hot roles (e.g., AI engineers)
- Strict external competitiveness creates pay compression (new hires paid more than veterans)

**Balanced Approach:**
> "We prioritize internal equity within a role/level, but allow 10-15% variance for external market rates and cost-of-living adjustments."

---

#### 3. Pay Transparency

**Fully Transparent (e.g., Buffer, GitLab):**
- Publish all salaries publicly or to all employees
- Use formula-based comp (role + level + location = salary)

**Partially Transparent (most companies):**
- Share pay ranges for each level
- Explain merit matrix and promotion guidelines
- Don't share individual salaries

**Opaque (older companies):**
- No ranges shared, no explanation of process
- Employees prohibited from discussing pay (illegal under NLRA)

**Trend:** Moving toward transparency (required by law in CO, CA, NY, WA)

---

#### 4. Geographic Pay Differentials

Do you pay the same salary regardless of location, or adjust for cost of living?

**Geo-Neutral (single salary for role):**
- Pros: Simple, fair, attracts talent from LCOL areas
- Cons: Expensive (paying SF rates for Iowa employee)
- **Use when:** Small company (<50), all remote, high-margin business

**Geo-Adjusted (salary varies by location):**
- Pros: Cost-effective, locally competitive
- Cons: Complex, perceived as unfair, hard to manage relocations
- **Use when:** Large company, tight margins, multiple offices

**Example Geo Tiers:**
- Tier 1 (SF, NYC, Seattle): 100% of range
- Tier 2 (Austin, Boston, Denver): 85-90%
- Tier 3 (Remote in LCOL): 70-80%

---

## Special Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Retention Counter-Offer

**Employee has outside offer for 30% more. Do you match?**

**Framework:**
1. **Is the employee a top performer?** (Yes = consider, No = let them leave)
2. **Is the outside offer realistic?** (Verify with market data)
3. **What's the retention risk?** (Hard to replace = match, easy to replace = don't)
4. **Will this create internal equity issues?** (If you match, others will demand raises)

**Counter-Offer Guidelines:**
- Match if: Top performer, market-rate offer, critical role, retention risk
- Don't match if: Average performer, inflated offer, replaceable role
- **Middle ground:** Offer 10-15% raise + accelerated equity vesting (cheaper than full match)

**Communication:**
> "We value your contributions and want you to stay. Based on our market analysis, we can offer [X salary], which is [Y%] above your current pay. This brings you to the top of the range for your role. We can also accelerate [Z] options to vest immediately. However, if you're looking for [full 30% offer], we can't match that and remain fair to your peers."

**Risk:** 50% of counter-offer acceptances leave within 12 months anyway.

---

### Scenario 2: New Hire Paid More Than Veteran Employee

**Problem:** You hire a new Senior Engineer at $150K (market rate). Your veteran Senior Engineer is at $130K.

**Options:**

**A. Market adjust the veteran immediately:**
- Increase veteran to $145K (splits the difference)
- Communicate: "We conducted a market review and adjusted your salary to reflect current market rates."

**B. Merit increase + market adjustment:**
- Give veteran 5% merit raise ($136.5K) + $10K market adjustment ($146.5K)
- Communicate: "You're getting a merit raise for performance plus a market adjustment."

**C. Do nothing (risky):**
- Veteran finds out, feels undervalued, leaves
- You now have to backfill at $150K+ anyway

**Recommended:** Option A or B. Proactive adjustments are cheaper than turnover.

---

### Scenario 3: Employee Promoted but Already Highly Paid

**Problem:** Employee promoted from Senior → Staff, but already at $175K (top of Staff range: $150K-$180K)

**Options:**

**A. Small raise + large equity grant:**
- Salary: $177K (small 1.1% bump to acknowledge promotion)
- Equity: 2x standard refresh (reward promotion with equity, not cash)

**B. Title-only promotion:**
- No raise, just title change
- Communicate: "You're already compensated at the top of the Staff range, so this promotion recognizes your impact. We'll focus on equity and bonus for future rewards."

**C. Off-cycle market adjustment later:**
- Promote now at $175K, reassess in 6 months if market moves

**Recommended:** Option A (equity-heavy promotion)

---

## Example Workflow

**User:** "We have a $500K merit budget for 100 employees. How should I allocate raises?"

**Your Response:**
1. Calculate average raise: $500K / 100 = $5K per employee (3.3% if avg salary is $150K)
2. Ask clarifying questions:
   - "What's your performance rating distribution? (e.g., 10% Exceeds, 70% Meets, 20% Below)"
   - "Are promotions included in this budget or separate?"
   - "Do you have pay equity issues or market compression we need to address?"
3. Build merit matrix (from `merit-matrix-calculator.md`)
4. Show allocation breakdown:
   - Exceeds + low compa-ratio: 5-6% raises
   - Meets + mid compa-ratio: 3-4% raises
   - Below expectations: 0-1% raises
5. Provide manager communication script
6. **Warn:** "Reserve 10% of budget ($50K) for calibration adjustments and pay equity fixes."
