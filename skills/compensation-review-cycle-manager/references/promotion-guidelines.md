# Promotion Guidelines & Salary Increase Benchmarks

Comprehensive guidelines for calculating salary increases for promotions across all roles and levels.

---

## Promotion Increase Formula

**New Salary = Max of:**
1. **New range minimum + 10%** (ensure employee enters new range comfortably)
2. **Current salary + standard promotion %** (10-20% depending on jump)
3. **Market rate for new role** (P50 or P60 depending on comp philosophy)

**Always check:** Internal equity with peers at the new level

---

## Standard Promotion Increase Ranges

| Promotion Type | Typical Increase | Examples |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Same Track, One Level** | 10-15% | Engineer II → Engineer III, Sales Rep → Senior Sales Rep |
| **Large Level Jump** | 15-20% | Engineer II → Senior Engineer (skipping III) |
| **Track Change (IC → Manager)** | 15-20% | Senior Engineer → Engineering Manager |
| **Manager → Senior Manager** | 15-18% | Engineering Manager → Senior Engineering Manager |
| **Manager → Director** | 20-25% | Engineering Manager → Director of Engineering |
| **Director → VP** | 25-30% | Director → VP of Engineering |

## Promotion Increases by Function

### Engineering / Product / Design

| From Level | To Level | Typical Increase | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Engineer I | Engineer II | 10-12% | Standard progression |
| Engineer II | Engineer III | 10-15% | Most common promotion |
| Engineer III | Senior Engineer | 12-15% | Significant scope increase |
| Senior Engineer | Staff Engineer | 15-20% | Strategic/technical leadership added |
| Staff Engineer | Principal Engineer | 15-20% | Org-wide impact |
| Senior Engineer | Engineering Manager | 15-20% | IC to manager track switch |
| Engineering Manager | Senior EM | 15-18% | Managing multiple teams |
| Senior EM | Director of Eng | 20-25% | Managing managers |
| Director | VP of Engineering | 25-30% | Executive level |

**Special Cases:**
- **Staff+ to Manager:** Often no increase (or small 5-10%) since Staff Engineers are already highly paid
- **Manager back to IC:** Typically no increase or even slight decrease (returning to IC track)

### Sales

| From Level | To Level | Typical Increase (Base) | Typical Increase (OTE) | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| SDR/BDR | Account Executive | 20-30% | 30-50% | Big jump from inbound to closing |
| AE | Senior AE | 10-15% | 15-20% | Larger accounts, higher quotas |
| Senior AE | Enterprise AE | 15-20% | 20-25% | Strategic accounts |
| AE | Sales Manager | 15-20% | 20-25% | Managing team of AEs |
| Sales Manager | Director of Sales | 20-25% | 25-30% | Managing multiple teams/regions |

**Note:** Sales compensation is heavily commission-based. Focus on **OTE (On-Target Earnings)** increases, not just base.

**Example:**
- Current: $80K base + $80K commission = $160K OTE
- Promoted to Senior AE: $90K base + $110K commission = $200K OTE (25% OTE increase, 12.5% base increase)

---

### Marketing

| From Level | To Level | Typical Increase | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Marketing Coordinator | Marketing Manager | 15-20% | First manager role |
| Marketing Manager | Senior Marketing Manager | 12-15% | Scope/budget increase |
| Senior Manager | Director of Marketing | 18-22% | Managing multiple functions |
| Director | VP of Marketing | 25-30% | C-suite level |

| Support Specialist | Senior Specialist | 8-10% | Escalations / mentoring |
| Senior Specialist | Support Manager | 15-18% | Team management |

## Promotion Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard IC Promotion

**Employee:** Sarah Johnson, Software Engineer II
- Current Salary: $130,000
- Performance: Exceeds Expectations
- Promotion: Software Engineer III

**Pay Ranges:**
- Engineer II: $110K - $150K (midpoint: $130K)
- Engineer III: $140K - $180K (midpoint: $160K)

**Calculation:**
1. **New range minimum + 10%:** $140K + $14K = $154K
2. **Current + 12% promotion increase:** $130K × 1.12 = $145.6K
3. **Market rate (P60):** ~$165K

**Recommended New Salary:** $154,000
- **Increase:** $24K (18.5%)
- **Compa-ratio in new range:** $154K / $160K = 0.96 (96% of midpoint - good positioning)
- **Rationale:** Exceeds min + 10%, competitive for Eng III, room to grow

---

### Example 2: Large Level Jump Promotion

**Employee:** Michael Chen, Account Executive
- Current Salary: $90,000 base + $90,000 commission = $180,000 OTE
- Performance: Exceptional
- Promotion: Enterprise Account Executive (skipping Senior AE level)

**Pay Ranges:**
- AE: $80K-$100K base, $160K-$200K OTE
- Senior AE: $95K-$120K base, $190K-$240K OTE
- Enterprise AE: $110K-$140K base, $220K-$280K OTE

**Calculation:**
1. **New range minimum + 10%:** $220K OTE (not just base)
2. **Current + 20% (large jump):** $180K × 1.20 = $216K OTE
3. **Market rate for Enterprise AE:** $250K OTE (P60)

**Recommended New Compensation:**
- **Base:** $115,000 (28% increase)
- **Commission:** $125,000 (39% increase)
- **Total OTE:** $240,000 (33% increase from $180K)

**Rationale:** Large jump (skipping level), exceptional performance, competitive Enterprise AE package

---

### Example 3: IC to Manager Promotion

**Employee:** Lisa Park, Senior Product Designer
- Current Salary: $155,000
- Performance: Exceeds Expectations
- Promotion: Design Manager (first management role)

**Pay Ranges:**
- Senior Designer: $140K-$170K (midpoint: $155K)
- Design Manager: $160K-$200K (midpoint: $180K)

**Calculation:**
1. **New range minimum + 10%:** $160K + $16K = $176K
2. **Current + 18% (IC to manager):** $155K × 1.18 = $182.9K
3. **Market rate:** $185K (P60)

**Recommended New Salary:** $180,000
- **Increase:** $25K (16.1%)
- **Compa-ratio:** $180K / $180K = 1.0 (at midpoint)
- **Rationale:** First manager role, aligns with market, room for growth in range

---

### Example 4: Already Highly Paid (Top of Range)

**Employee:** David Kim, Staff Engineer
- Current Salary: $210,000 (top of Staff range: $180K-$220K)
- Performance: Exceptional
- Promotion: Principal Engineer

**Pay Ranges:**
- Staff Engineer: $180K-$220K (midpoint: $200K)
- Principal Engineer: $220K-$280K (midpoint: $250K)

**Problem:** David is already at 105% of Staff midpoint (top of range). Standard 15% increase = $241.5K, but that's only 97% of Principal midpoint. Risk: David feels undervalued.

**Calculation:**
1. **New range minimum + 10%:** $220K + $22K = $242K
2. **Current + 15%:** $241.5K
3. **Market rate for Principal:** $260K (P65)
4. **Target compa-ratio (1.0):** $250K

**Recommended Package:**
- **Base Salary:** $245,000 (16.7% increase)
- **Equity Refresh:** 2x standard refresh grant (add $30K/year in equity value)
- **Total Compensation Increase:** ~$50K (24%)

**Rationale:** Salary alone isn't enough (only gets to 0.98 compa-ratio). Combine with large equity grant to make promotion meaningful.

## When to Deviate from Standard Ranges

### Give MORE than standard range when:
- **Retention risk:** Competitor is recruiting the employee
- **Exceptional performance:** Top 5% performer, critical to business
- **Underpaid currently:** Employee below market for current level
- **Large scope increase:** Promotion adds significant new responsibilities (e.g., managing 20-person team vs 5-person team)

### Give LESS than standard range when:
- **Already highly paid:** Current salary is at top of current range or even into next range
- **Promotion in title only:** Scope didn't increase much (e.g., "Staff Engineer" title but already doing that work)
- **Equity-heavy promotion:** Large equity grant compensates for smaller cash increase
- **Budget constraints:** Company financial situation

---

## Internal Equity Checks

**Before finalizing promotion salary, check:**

### 1. Compare to Peers at New Level

**Example:**
- Promoting Jane to Senior Engineer at $160K
- Other Senior Engineers: $150K, $155K, $162K, $165K
- **Check:** Jane at $160K is in range ✓

**Red Flag:** Jane would be the highest-paid Senior Engineer despite just being promoted

**Fix:** Adjust to $155K-$157K to maintain equity, or justify with exceptional performance

---

### 2. Compare to Recently Promoted Peers

**Example:**
- Promoting John from Engineer II → III with 18% increase
- Last quarter, Maria got Engineer II → III with 12% increase

**Red Flag:** Why is John getting 6% more than Maria for same promotion?

**Fix:** Either:
- Justify (John is higher performer, Maria was already high in range)
- Equalize (give Maria a market adjustment)
- Adjust John to 12-15%

---

### 3. Check Against New Hire Market Rate

**Example:**
- Promoting Sarah to Product Manager at $140K
- New PM hires are getting offers at $155K

**Red Flag:** Sarah will be underpaid vs external hires (retention risk)

**Fix:** Increase to $150K-$155K to match market

## Promotion Communication Templates

### Template 1: Standard Promotion (One Level)

> **Subject:** Your Promotion to [New Title]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm excited to share that you've been promoted to **[New Title]**, effective [Date]. This promotion recognizes your [specific achievements: leadership on Project X, mentorship of junior team members, impact on revenue growth].
>
> **Compensation Changes:**
> - **New Salary:** $[New Salary] (a [X%] increase from your current salary of $[Old Salary])
> - **Equity Grant:** [X] RSUs vesting over 4 years (if applicable)
>
> Your new salary places you at [compa-ratio description: "the midpoint of the [New Title] range," or "in line with peers at this level"].

---

### Template 2: Promotion with Below-Average Increase (Already Highly Paid)

>
> I'm excited to promote you to **[New Title]**, effective [Date]. This recognizes the [Staff-level work you've already been doing / strategic impact you've had on the organization].
>

> - **New Salary:** $[New Salary] (a [X%] increase)
> - **Equity Grant:** [X] RSUs (2x standard refresh) vesting over 4 years
>
> I know the salary increase is modest compared to typical promotions. This is because you're already compensated at the top of the [Old Title] range, and your new salary places you at [95%] of the [New Title] midpoint. To recognize this promotion, we're also granting a **2x equity refresh**, which adds approximately $[X] in annual equity value.

## Legal Considerations

### Pay Equity Impact

**Risk:** Promotions can perpetuate pay gaps if not carefully reviewed.

**Example:**
- Male employee promoted with 15% increase → $150K
- Female employee (same role, same performance) promoted with 12% increase → $145K
- **Gap created:** $5K pay difference at same level

**Mitigation:**
1. **Standardize promotion increases** by level/function
2. **Audit promotions by demographic** (check for disparate impact)
3. **Document justification** for any deviations from standard %
4. **Correct gaps immediately** (don't let them compound)

---

### Title Inflation vs. Real Promotions

**Title Inflation:** Giving title promotion without compensation increase or scope change

**Risk:**
- Creates internal equity issues (title ≠ pay)
- Devalues the title (everyone is a "Senior" or "Principal")
- Legal risk if title suggests exempt status but role is non-exempt

**Best Practice:** Only promote when BOTH title AND scope increase

---

## Promotion Budget Planning

### How to Forecast Promotion Costs

**Formula:**
```
Promotion Budget = Avg Salary × Promotion Rate × Avg Increase %
```

**Example:**
- Total employees: 200
- Average salary: $120,000
- Promotion rate: 15% (30 promotions)
- Average promotion increase: 15%

**Calculation:**
```
Promotion Budget = ($120,000 × 30 employees × 0.15) = $540,000
```

**Breakdown:**
- Merit budget (3% × $24M payroll): $720,000
- Promotion budget: $540,000
- **Total comp budget:** $1,260,000 (5.25% of payroll)

---

### Promotion Rate Benchmarks

| Company Size | Typical Annual Promotion Rate | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------------|-------|
| <50 employees | 20-30% | Fast growth, fewer levels |
| 50-200 employees | 15-20% | Building structure |
| 200-500 employees | 10-15% | Maturing org |
| 500-1,000 employees | 8-12% | Established levels |
| 1,000+ employees | 5-10% | Large, stable org |

**High-growth startups:** 25-40% promotion rate (rapid expansion, many people leveling up)
