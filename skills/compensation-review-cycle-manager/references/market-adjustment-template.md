# Market Adjustment Analysis & Templates

How to identify, calculate, and communicate market-based salary adjustments.

## What is a Market Adjustment?

A **market adjustment** is a salary increase given to bring an employee's pay up to market rate, independent of performance or merit increases.

**When to use:**
- Employee's salary falls significantly below market rate (>10% gap)
- Market rates for the role increased dramatically (e.g., AI/ML engineers)
- Pay compression (long-tenured employee paid less than new hires)
- Retention risk (competitor offers or active job searching)
- Pay equity correction (demographic pay gaps)

**When NOT to use:**
- Performance-based raises (use merit increases instead)
- Promotions (use promotion guidelines)
- General cost-of-living increases

## Step 1: Identify Market Gaps

### Data Sources for Market Benchmarking

**Paid Salary Surveys:**
- **Radford:** Tech industry standard (expensive, $10K-$50K/year)
- **Mercer:** Broad industry coverage
- **Pave / Carta:** Startup-focused, equity data included
- **Culpepper:** Good for mid-market companies

**Free / Crowdsourced Data:**
- **Levels.fyi:** Tech compensation (crowdsourced, high accuracy)
- **Glassdoor / Indeed:** Directional data (not precise)
- **LinkedIn Salary:** Basic benchmarking
- **Payscale:** Individual job role data

**Primary Research:**
- Competitor job postings (if salary ranges listed - required in CO, CA, NY, WA)
- Recruiter outreach (ask what candidates are seeing in market)
- Offer data from candidates you hired recently

---

### Market Rate Calculation

**Target percentile depends on your comp philosophy:**
- **P50 (Median):** "At market" - most common target
- **P60-P65:** "Slightly above market" - competitive positioning
- **P75:** "Top quartile" - aggressive talent acquisition
- **P90+:** "Top of market" - only for critical scarce roles

**Example:**
- **Role:** Senior Software Engineer, San Francisco
- **Market data (P50):** $175,000
- **Market data (P75):** $195,000
- **Your comp philosophy:** Target P60 = ~$180,000

---

### Identify Gaps

**Formula:**
```
Market Gap % = (Market Rate - Current Salary) / Current Salary × 100
```

**Example:**
- Employee current salary: $140,000
- Market rate (P60): $180,000
- **Gap:** ($180K - $140K) / $140K = **28.6% below market**

**Prioritize by gap size:**
- **< 5% gap:** Monitor, address at next merit cycle
- **5-10% gap:** Consider mid-year adjustment for top performers
- **10-15% gap:** High priority, adjust within 3-6 months
- **15%+ gap:** **Critical retention risk** - adjust immediately

---

## Step 2: Create Market Adjustment Plan

### Market Adjustment Analysis Spreadsheet Template

| Employee Name | Role | Current Salary | Market Rate (P60) | Gap ($) | Gap (%) | Priority | Recommended Adjustment | New Salary | Cost |
|--------------|------|---------------|------------------|---------|---------|----------|----------------------|-----------|------|
| Jane Doe | Sr. Engineer | $140,000 | $180,000 | $40,000 | 28.6% | High | $30,000 | $170,000 | $30,000 |
| John Smith | Product Manager | $125,000 | $145,000 | $20,000 | 16.0% | High | $15,000 | $140,000 | $15,000 |
| Maria Garcia | Designer | $95,000 | $115,000 | $20,000 | 21.1% | High | $15,000 | $110,000 | $15,000 |
| Alex Chen | Sales Manager | $115,000 | $120,000 | $5,000 | 4.3% | Low | Defer to merit | $115,000 | $0 |
| **Total** | | | | | | | | | **$60,000** |

**Budget allocation:**
- Total payroll: $20M
- Market adjustment budget: 0.3% of payroll = $60,000
- Covers 3 high-priority adjustments

---

### Prioritization Matrix

Not all gaps need immediate fixing. Prioritize based on:

| Criteria | Weight | Jane Doe | John Smith | Maria Garcia | Alex Chen |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Gap Size (%)** | 40% | 28.6% = 10/10 | 16.0% = 6/10 | 21.1% = 8/10 | 4.3% = 2/10 |
| **Performance** | 30% | Exceeds = 9/10 | Meets = 7/10 | Exceeds = 9/10 | Meets = 7/10 |
| **Retention Risk** | 20% | High = 9/10 | Medium = 5/10 | High = 8/10 | Low = 3/10 |
| **Business Impact** | 10% | Critical = 10/10 | Important = 7/10 | Important = 7/10 | Standard = 5/10 |
| **Total Score** | | **9.5** | **6.3** | **8.5** | **3.7** |

**Priority Order:**
1. Jane Doe (9.5) - Largest gap, top performer, critical role
2. Maria Garcia (8.5) - Large gap, top performer, retention risk
3. John Smith (6.3) - Medium gap, solid performer
4. Alex Chen (3.7) - Small gap, defer to annual merit cycle

---

## Step 3: Calculate Adjustments

### Full Gap vs. Partial Gap Closure

**Option 1: Close the Full Gap**
- Bring employee to exact market rate (P50, P60, or P75)
- **Pros:** Solves problem completely, strong retention signal
- **Cons:** Expensive, may overshoot if market data is imprecise

**Option 2: Close 70-80% of Gap**
- Leave small gap for merit raises to fill over time
- **Pros:** Lower cost, still shows commitment
- **Cons:** Employee may still feel underpaid

**Option 3: Close Gap to Range Midpoint**
- Bring employee to midpoint of internal pay range (may be < market)
- **Pros:** Ensures internal equity
- **Cons:** May not solve retention risk if midpoint < market

---

### Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Full Gap Closure

**Employee:** Jane Doe, Senior Engineer
- Current: $140,000
- Market (P60): $180,000
- Gap: 28.6%

**Adjustment:** $40,000 → New salary: $180,000

**Rationale:** Top performer, critical retention risk, large gap

---

#### Example 2: 75% Gap Closure

**Employee:** John Smith, Product Manager
- Current: $125,000
- Market (P60): $145,000
- Gap: $20,000 (16%)

**Adjustment:** $15,000 (75% of gap) → New salary: $140,000

**Rationale:** Solid performer, no immediate retention risk, budget constraints

**Communication:**
> "We're adjusting your salary to $140,000, which brings you within 3.5% of market rate. You'll also receive a merit increase at the annual review in 3 months, which will bring you to full market rate."

---

#### Example 3: Adjustment to Range Midpoint (Internal Equity Fix)

**Employee:** Maria Garcia, Designer
- Current: $95,000
- Market (P60): $115,000
- Internal range midpoint: $105,000
- Gap to midpoint: $10,000

**Adjustment:** $10,000 → New salary: $105,000

**Rationale:** Brings Maria to midpoint of range, closes most gap, maintains equity with other designers

**Follow-up:** Review ranges next year to ensure they match market

## Step 4: Communication Templates

### Template 1: Proactive Market Adjustment (No Employee Request)

**Subject:** Compensation Adjustment

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm reaching out to share some good news. After conducting our annual compensation benchmarking, we identified that your salary is below the current market rate for [Role] in [Location].
>
> **Effective [Date], your salary will increase to $[New Salary].**
>
> This is a **$[Adjustment Amount] market adjustment** (a [X%] increase from your current salary of $[Old Salary]). This adjustment is in addition to any merit increase you'll receive during the annual review cycle in [Month].

>
> Let me know if you have any questions.
>
> Best,

### Template 2: Reactive Market Adjustment (Employee Raised Concern)

**Subject:** Re: Compensation Discussion

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thank you for sharing your concerns about your compensation. I took your feedback seriously and worked with HR to conduct a market analysis for your role.
>
> **Here's what we found:**
> Based on current market data for [Role] in [Location], the median salary is approximately $[Market Rate]. Your current salary of $[Current Salary] is [X%] below this benchmark.
>
> **We're making the following adjustment, effective [Date]:**
> - **New Salary:** $[New Salary]
> - **Increase:** $[Adjustment] ([X%])
>
> This brings you to [within X% of market rate / to the P50 / above the midpoint of our internal range].
>
> **I also want to address:**
> I should have been more proactive about this. I value your contributions to [specific project/impact], and I'm committed to ensuring you're compensated fairly. Going forward, I'll be more diligent about reviewing market rates during our annual compensation cycle.
>
> Let's schedule time to discuss your compensation and career goals in more detail. I want to make sure we're aligned on your growth path here.
>
> Thank you for raising this with me.
>
> [Manager Name]

### Template 3: Counter-Offer (Employee Has Outside Offer)

**Subject:** Retention Offer

> Hi [Name],
>
> Thank you for being transparent with me about the offer you received from [Company]. I want you to know how much we value your work here, especially your impact on [specific contributions].
>
> I've worked with HR and leadership to put together a retention package:
>
> **Compensation Changes:**
> - **New Salary:** $[New Salary] (a [X%] increase from $[Old Salary])
> - **Equity Grant:** [X] RSUs vesting over 4 years (or accelerated vesting of [Y] existing options)
> - **Bonus:** [If applicable: One-time retention bonus of $[Amount]]
>
> **Why we're doing this:**
> Your current salary was below market, and the external offer highlighted this gap. This adjustment brings you to [P65 of market / top of our range for this role], which reflects the value you bring to the team.
>
> **Beyond Compensation:**
> I also want to address [any non-comp concerns: scope, growth, work-life balance]. Here's what I'm committing to:
> - [Action 1: e.g., "Expanded scope to lead the Platform team"]
> - [Action 2: e.g., "Promotion to Staff Engineer in 6 months with defined milestones"]
>
> I understand this is a big decision. I'd love to discuss this in person and answer any questions.
>
> I hope you'll choose to stay. But whatever you decide, I respect your choice.
>
> [Manager Name]

### Template 4: Pay Equity Adjustment (Sensitive)

**Subject:** Compensation Adjustment

> Hi [Name],
>
> As part of our commitment to pay equity, we conduct annual compensation audits to ensure employees are paid fairly regardless of gender, race, or other protected characteristics.
>
> During this year's audit, we identified that your compensation is below the median for [Role] at our company, even after accounting for performance, tenure, and experience.
>
> **Effective [Date], your salary will increase to $[New Salary].**
>
> This is a **$[Adjustment Amount] pay equity adjustment** (a [X%] increase from your current salary of $[Old Salary]).
>
> **This adjustment is separate from your annual merit increase,** which you'll receive in [Month] based on your performance.
>
> We take pay equity seriously, and we're continuously working to ensure our compensation practices are fair. Thank you for your contributions to the team.
>
> Please let me know if you have any questions.
>
> [Manager Name]

**Note:** Be careful with this language. In some cases, explicitly calling it a "pay equity adjustment" can be seen as an admission of discrimination. Consult legal counsel.

**Alternative phrasing:**
> "We identified that your compensation is below the midpoint for your role and have made a market adjustment to correct this."

## Step 5: Pay Compression Analysis

**Pay compression** occurs when:
- New hires are paid more than long-tenured employees in the same role
- Promoted employees end up earning less than new hires at their new level
- Market rates increase faster than internal merit raises

---

### How to Detect Pay Compression

**Formula:**
```
Compression Ratio = Median Salary (Tenured Employees) / Median Salary (New Hires)
```

**Healthy Ratio:** 1.0 to 1.15 (tenured employees paid the same or slightly more)
**Compression:** < 1.0 (new hires paid more than tenured employees)

---

### Example: Pay Compression Analysis

**Role:** Software Engineer III

| Employee | Tenure | Salary | Hired/Promoted |
|----------|--------|--------|---------------|
| Alice | 4 years | $145,000 | 2020 hire at $120K → promoted 2022 |
| Bob | 3 years | $150,000 | 2021 hire at $135K |
| Carlos | 6 months | $165,000 | 2024 hire |
| Dana | 2 months | $170,000 | 2024 hire |

**Analysis:**
- **Median tenured (Alice, Bob):** $147,500
- **Median new hire (Carlos, Dana):** $167,500
- **Compression Ratio:** $147,500 / $167,500 = **0.88**

**Problem:** New hires paid 13.6% more than tenured employees in same role.

**Solution:**
- Market adjust Alice and Bob to $165K (closes gap to new hires)
- Total cost: $35,000
- Alternative: Don't fix, risk Alice and Bob leaving

## Legal & Compliance Considerations

### Pay Equity Laws

**California SB 1162:**
- Employers with 100+ employees must report pay data by race/gender (annually)
- Must conduct pay equity audits (recommended, not legally required yet)

**Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act:**
- Employers must announce job opportunities to all employees
- Must disclose pay range in job postings

**New York Pay Transparency Law:**
- Must disclose salary range in job postings (effective 2023)

**Massachusetts Equal Pay Act:**
- Prohibits pay discrimination based on gender
- Requires employers to conduct regular pay audits

---

### Documentation Requirements

**For every market adjustment, document:**
- Market data source (e.g., "Radford survey, P60 for Senior Engineer in SF")
- Current salary vs. market rate (gap %)
- Rationale for adjustment amount (full gap vs. partial)
- Approval (manager + HR + finance)
- Effective date

**Retain records for 3+ years** (required for pay discrimination defense)

---

## Budget Planning for Market Adjustments

**Rule of Thumb:** Allocate **0.3-0.5% of total payroll** for market adjustments

**Example:**
- Total payroll: $20M
- Market adjustment budget: 0.4% = $80,000
- Can cover ~5-10 adjustments (avg $8K-$16K each)

**If budget is insufficient:**
1. **Prioritize by retention risk** (top performers, critical roles first)
2. **Phase adjustments** (Q1: critical roles, Q2: next tier)
3. **Negotiate raises instead of full adjustments** (e.g., close 70% of gap instead of 100%)

---

## FAQ: Manager Questions

**Q: "What if I can't afford to fix all market gaps?"**
A: Prioritize top performers and critical retention risks. For others, communicate a timeline: "We'll address this at the next annual review" or "We'll close the gap over 2 years with larger merit increases."

**Q: "Should I tell the employee how much below market they were?"**
A: **Transparency option:** "You were X% below market, and we've adjusted you to market rate."
**Vague option:** "We conducted a market analysis and determined your salary should be $[X]."
**Recommendation:** Be transparent if the employee already knows (e.g., they brought data). Be vague if proactive adjustment.

**Q: "What if the employee asks for more after the adjustment?"**
A: "This adjustment brings you to [market rate / top of range]. We're not able to go higher at this time, but we'll reassess at the next review cycle. Your total compensation (salary + equity + bonus) is [competitive/above market]."
