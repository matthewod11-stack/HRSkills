## How to Use This Matrix

**For Career Planning:**
1. Identify employee's current level
2. Find competencies at target level
3. Compare: where are the gaps?
4. Build development plan to close gaps

**For Promotion Decisions:**
1. Assess: Is employee demonstrating next-level competencies?
2. Not just "doing well" at current level
3. Need to show they're **already operating** at next level
4. Consistent performance (3-6 months), not one-off

**For Hiring:**
1. Use competencies to assess candidates
2. Interview questions should probe for level-appropriate skills
3. Calibrate offers based on demonstrated competencies

**Remember:**
- Not all competencies equally weighted (technical depth > presentations for IC1)
- Need to demonstrate **most** competencies, not all
- Gaps are okay if offset by exceptional strength elsewhere
- Competencies grow over time with practice and feedback
