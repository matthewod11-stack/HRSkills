## Choosing IC vs Management

### IC Track is for you if:

- ✅ Love deep work (coding, product work, analysis)
- ✅ Energized by solving hard problems
- ✅ Want to stay hands-on
- ✅ Influence through expertise
- ✅ Prefer flexibility (fewer meetings)

### Management Track is for you if:

- ✅ Energized by helping others succeed
- ✅ Enjoy coaching and developing people
- ✅ Like org design and strategy
- ✅ Willing to trade hands-on work for team impact
- ✅ Comfortable with ambiguity and people problems

### Key Points:

- **IC and Manager are parallel tracks** - equal pay and respect
- **Management is not a promotion** - it's a career change
- **You can switch tracks** - IC→Manager or Manager→IC (though harder to go back)
- **Most people should stay IC** - only ~1 in 8 engineers should manage
- **Try before you commit** - lead projects, mentor, see if you like it
