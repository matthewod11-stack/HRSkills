## Scenario 5: Taylor Kim - Product Manager, Lateral Move Interest

**Profile:**
- **Role:** Product Manager (IC3)
- **Tenure:** 2 years
- **Department:** Growth (onboarding, activation)
- **Interest:** Move to Platform team (infrastructure PM)

**Why Lateral Move?**
- Bored with growth metrics (wants deeper technical work)
- Interested in building platform for other PMs
- Fresh challenge, skill building
- Long-term: opens more opportunities (platform→infrastructure→leadership)

**Considerations:**
- May "step back" in knowledge (learning curve)
- Platform PM requires more technical depth
- Growth PM experience is valuable (don't lose skills)
- Timeline: 6-12 months transition

**Career Plan:**

**Phase 1: Validate Interest (Months 1-3)**
- Shadow Platform PM (attend meetings, read docs)
- Contribute to platform roadmap (part-time)
- Learn technical concepts (APIs, databases, infra)
- Confirm: Still interested after seeing reality?

**Phase 2: Build Technical Skills (Months 3-6)**
- Take courses: System design, APIs, developer experience
- Read: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
- Partner with eng on technical features
- Credibility: Demonstrate can handle technical PM work

**Phase 3: Transition (Months 6-12)**
- Apply for Platform PM role (if available)
- OR: Gradual shift (split time 50/50)
- OR: Hire new Growth PM, move Taylor to Platform

**Alternative: Stay Growth, Go Deeper**
- Senior PM on Growth (IC4)
- Own entire growth org (activation + retention + expansion)
- Build broader skill set (don't just switch)

**Recommendation:** Try platform work part-time first (validate), then commit

## Scenario 6: Chris Johnson - Director of Engineering, Burnout

**Profile:**
- **Role:** Director of Engineering (M5)
- **Tenure:** 4 years (early employee)
- **Reports:** 30 engineers (2 managers + some ICs)
- **Issue:** Overwhelmed, considering IC switch

**Current State:**
- Manages too many direct reports (should be 5-8, has 12+)
- Doing manager work + IC work (no time for strategy)
- Missing 1:1s, team unhappy
- Considering: "Maybe I should go back to IC4?"

**Root Cause:** **Org design issue, not role mismatch**
- Need to hire more managers (flatten org)
- Director shouldn't have 12 directs
- Need M4 layer (Senior Manager / Group Manager)

**Career Plan:**

**Option 1: Fix Org Structure (Recommended)**
- Hire 2 Engineering Managers (M3)
- Promote 1 IC4 to M3
- Director now manages 3-4 managers (sustainable)
- Can focus on strategy, not tactics

**Timeline:**
- Q1: Hire EM for Team A
- Q2: Promote IC4 to EM for Team B
- Q3: Hire EM for Team C
- Result: Director with 4 reports (2 EMs + 2 senior ICs)

**Option 2: Step Down to IC4 (If truly wants IC)**
- Transition to Staff Engineer role
- Someone else becomes Director
- Trade-off: Pay cut, less influence
- Upside: Deep technical work, less people management

**Assessment:**
- Does Chris actually dislike management? Or just overwhelmed?
- If he likes strategy, team building → Fix org structure
- If he misses coding, technical work → Consider IC4
- **Likely:** He needs support, not role change

**Immediate Actions:**
- Hire executive coach (support Director)
- Delegate more to managers
- Time audit (what's taking time?)
- Org restructure plan (hire managers)
