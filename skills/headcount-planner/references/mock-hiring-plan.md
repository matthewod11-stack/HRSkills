## Ramp Time Impact

**Effective Headcount (accounting for ramp):**

### Engineering (3-month ramp)
- Q1 hires: 25% → 50% → 75% → 100%
- Q2 hires: 25% → 50% → 75%
- Q3 hires: 25% → 50%
- Q4 hires: 25%

**Example:**
- Hire 3 engineers in Q1
- Q1 effective: 3 × 0.25 = 0.75
- Q2 effective: 3 × 0.50 = 1.5
- Q3 effective: 3 × 0.75 = 2.25
- Q4 effective: 3 × 1.0 = 3.0

### Sales (6-month ramp to quota)
- Months 1-2: 0% (learning)
- Months 3-4: 25% to quota
- Months 5-6: 50% to quota
- Month 7+: 80-100% to quota

**Example:**
- Hire 2 AEs in Q1 (Feb 1)
- Q1 contribution: $0 (training)
- Q2 contribution: 2 × $150K quota × 0.25 = $75K
- Q3 contribution: 2 × $150K quota × 0.50 = $150K
- Q4 contribution: 2 × $150K quota × 0.90 = $270K

## Org Ratio Tracking

### Current (Q4 2023):
```
Eng:PM = 30:10 = 3:1 ❌ (Target: 5:1 to 8:1)
SDR:AE = 4:11 = 0.4:1 ❌ (Target: 2:1 to 3:1)
AE:CSM = 11:7 = 1.6:1 ⚠️ (Target: 3:1 to 5:1)
```

### End of Year (Q4 2024):
```
Eng:PM = 45:13 = 3.5:1 ⚠️ Still low (SLOW PM HIRING)
SDR:AE = 7:20 = 0.35:1 ❌ Need more SDRs
AE:CSM = 20:11 = 1.8:1 ⚠️ Hire more CSMs

```

**Actions Needed:**
- STOP hiring PMs (already have enough)
- INCREASE SDR hiring (need 2-3x AEs)
- Adjust CS hiring to keep pace

## Alternative Scenarios

### Scenario A: Conservative (25 hires, $5M cost)

**Headcount:** 75 → 100
**Revenue/Employee:** $200K (excellent)
**Risk:** May only hit $15M ARR (miss goal)
**Trade-off:** More efficient, less risk, slower growth

### Scenario C: Aggressive (60 hires, $12M cost)

**Headcount:** 75 → 135
**Revenue/Employee:** $148K (declining)
**Risk:** Higher burn, operational chaos, quality issues
**Trade-off:** Faster growth, more risk, lower efficiency

---

## Key Assumptions

1. **Revenue Model:**
   - Existing customers expand 20% (LTR/upsells)
   - New customer acquisition: 100 new customers
   - Average ACV: $150K

2. **Hiring Velocity:**
   - Currently hiring 1 person/month
   - Need to ramp to 3-4/month
   - Requires: Recruiting coordinator + agency support

3. **Retention:**
   - Assume 15% annual attrition (11 employees leave)
   - Need to backfill + net new
   - Actual net new: 29 hires (40 - 11 attrition)

4. **Compensation:**
   - Market competitive (P50)
   - Geographic mix: 50% SF, 30% Tier 2, 20% Remote

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Can't hire fast enough | Miss growth targets | High | Hire recruiter Q1, use agencies |
| Revenue misses target | Overstaffed | Medium | Quarterly check-ins, pause if lagging |
| Quality of hire drops | Technical debt, bad culture | Medium | Maintain interview bar, don't panic hire |
| Onboarding burden | New hires struggle, managers overwhelmed | High | Standardized onboarding, buddy system |
| Sales ramp slower than expected | Revenue gap | Medium | Hire AEs earlier, extend ramp assumptions |

---

## Tracking & Adjustments

**Monthly Metrics:**
- Hires vs Plan (are we on track?)
- Cost vs Budget (spending as expected?)
- Time to fill (how long to close roles?)
- Offer acceptance rate (winning candidates?)

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Revenue vs Plan (tracking to $20M?)
- Headcount vs Plan (did we hit hiring targets?)
- Productivity (revenue/employee improving?)
- Ratios (eng:PM, SDR:AE healthy?)

**Decision Points:**
- **If revenue ahead:** Accelerate hiring (move Q4 hires to Q3)
- **If revenue behind:** Pause hiring, reassess (don't throw people at problem)
- **If hiring behind:** Adjust plan down, extend timeline
