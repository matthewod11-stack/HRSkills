How to assess current skill levels accurately.

---

## Assessment Approach

### 1. Self-Assessment (Start Here)

**Ask the employee:**
"On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate yourself on [skill]?"

**Follow-up questions:**
- "What makes you say [X]?"
- "Can you give an example of when you demonstrated this?"
- "What would it take to get to the next level?"

**Note:** Self-assessments can be inflated (especially for men) or deflated (especially for women). Use as starting point, not final answer.

---

### 2. Manager Assessment

**Manager evaluates:**
- Based on observed performance
- Recent project outcomes
- Feedback from peers and stakeholders
- Consistency over time

**Rate on same 1-5 scale**

---

### 3. Calibrate (Reconcile Differences)

**If self-assessment > manager assessment:**
- Employee may overestimate skills
- Discuss specific examples
- Clarify what each level means

**If self-assessment < manager assessment:**
- Employee may underestimate (imposter syndrome)
- Provide positive reinforcement
- Share specific evidence of their skill level

**Goal:** Reach shared understanding of current level

## Evidence-Based Assessment

Don't just assign numbers. Look for **concrete evidence**:

### Level 1 (Beginner) Evidence
- Needs step-by-step guidance
- Makes frequent mistakes that require correction
- Asks many clarifying questions
- Recent to this skill (< 6 months)

### Level 2 (Intermediate) Evidence
- Can complete tasks with occasional guidance
- Quality is inconsistent
- Starting to teach themselves
- 6-12 months practicing skill

### Level 3 (Proficient) Evidence
- Completes work autonomously
- Consistent quality
- Rarely needs help
- Can explain concepts to others
- 1-2+ years of consistent practice

### Level 4 (Advanced) Evidence
- Handles complex scenarios independently
- Others seek their advice
- Improves processes and standards
- Mentors others effectively
- Recognized as expert by peers
- 3-5+ years of deep practice

### Level 5 (Master) Evidence
- Company-wide go-to person
- Creates new frameworks or approaches
- External recognition (talks, writing)
- Influences industry beyond company
- 5-10+ years of mastery

## Assessment by Role

### Software Engineer Assessment

**Test technical skills through:**
- Code review quality (for senior levels)
- System design exercise (for IC3+)
- Recent PRs and projects
- Incident response (debugging, problem-solving)
- Technical doc writing

**Questions to ask:**
- "Walk me through a recent technical decision you made"
- "How did you approach [recent project]?"
- "What's been your biggest technical challenge recently?"

---

### Product Manager Assessment

**Test product skills through:**
- Review recent specs and PRDs
- Product metrics and outcomes
- Customer interview notes
- Prioritization rationale

**Questions to ask:**
- "How do you decide what to build?"
- "Walk me through your customer discovery process"
- "How do you balance stakeholder requests?"
- "What metrics do you track and why?"

---

### Manager Assessment

**Test management skills through:**
- Employee feedback (skip-levels)
- Team performance and retention
- Hiring outcomes
- 1:1 agendas and notes

**Questions to ask:**
- "How do you coach underperformers?"
- "Walk me through a recent difficult conversation"
- "How do you develop your team?"

---

## 360-Degree Assessment

For senior roles (IC4+, M3+), gather input from multiple sources:

**Peers:**
- "How effective is [Name] at [skill]?"
- "What's [Name]'s biggest strength? Area for growth?"

**Direct Reports (for managers):**
- "Do you feel supported by your manager?"
- "What could your manager do better?"

**Stakeholders:**
- "How is [Name] to work with?"
- "Do they communicate effectively?"

**Aggregate feedback** to get fuller picture

## Common Assessment Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Recency Bias
**Problem:** Over-weight recent performance
**Fix:** Look at 6-12 month trend, not just last month

### Mistake 2: Halo Effect
**Problem:** One strong skill makes everything seem good
**Fix:** Assess each skill independently

### Mistake 3: Leniency Bias
**Problem:** Everyone is rated 3-4/5 (grade inflation)
**Fix:** Use clear level definitions, be honest

### Mistake 4: No Evidence
**Problem:** Ratings based on "feeling" not facts
**Fix:** Require specific examples for each rating

### Mistake 5: Comparing to Self
**Problem:** "They're better than I was at that level"
**Fix:** Compare to role expectations, not yourself

## Assessment Conversation Script

### Opening

"I want to do a skill assessment to understand where you are currently and where you want to grow. This will help us create a development plan together. Sound good?"

### For Each Skill

"Let's talk about [skill]. On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate yourself?"

[Listen to self-rating]

"What makes you say [X]? Can you give me an example?"

[Listen and discuss]

"Based on what I've observed, I'd rate you [Y] because [specific evidence]. How does that land?"

[Calibrate together]

"To get to the next level, you'd need to [specific next level criteria]. Does that make sense?"

### Closing

"Based on this assessment, here are your strengths: [list]. And here are areas to develop: [list]. Let's create a plan together to close those gaps."

---

## Assessment Frequency

**Regular employees:**
- Annual formal assessment
- Quarterly check-ins
- Continuous informal feedback

**High performers / promotion candidates:**
- Bi-annual formal assessment
- Monthly development check-ins

**Underperformers / PIPs:**
- Monthly formal assessment
- Weekly progress check-ins

---

## Rating Calibration Across Team

To ensure consistency:

1. **Define levels clearly:** Use frameworks from skills-frameworks.md
2. **Calibrate with peers:** Compare ratings across managers
3. **Use examples:** "An IC3 should be able to [X]. Can they?"
4. **Be honest:** Don't inflate to make people feel good
5. **Trends matter:** Focus on growth, not absolutes

---

## Development Readiness Indicators

### Ready for Next Level (Promote Now)
- Performing at next level for 6+ months consistently
- All critical skills at or above target
- Strong trajectory
- Manager and peers agree

### Nearly Ready (6 months)
- 1-2 skill gaps remaining
- Clear development plan in place
- Making visible progress
- High confidence they'll close gaps

### Not Yet Ready (12+ months)
- Multiple significant gaps
- Recent to current role (< 1 year)
- Inconsistent performance
- Needs more time to develop

### Not On Track

---

## Special Situations

### High Performer (Exceeds Current Level)
- May be ready for promotion early
- Assess if they can sustain performance
- Ensure they're not just good at one thing

### Solid Performer (Meets Current Level)
- May stay at level for years (and that's okay!)
- Focus on deepening expertise
- Not everyone needs to be promoted

### Struggling Performer
- Assess if they're in right role
- May need to move laterally
- Clear performance plan needed

## Key Principles

1. **Evidence-based:** Use specific examples, not feelings
2. **Consistent:** Apply same standards to everyone
3. **Honest:** Don't sugarcoat or inflate
4. **Growth-focused:** Frame as development opportunity
5. **Collaborative:** Assess together, not to them

Great assessment is the foundation for effective development planning.
