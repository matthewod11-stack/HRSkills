## Strategy 1: Stretch Projects

### What It Is
Assign projects slightly above current skill level with support.

### How to Design
1. **Identify the skill to develop** (e.g., "System design")
2. **Create project that requires that skill** (e.g., "Design new API architecture")
3. **Provide scaffolding** (mentor check-ins, resources)
4. **Set clear success criteria**
5. **Review and reflect** after completion

### Examples by Skill

**System Design (for IC2 → IC3):**
- Design API for new feature
- Architect database schema for product area
- Create scalable solution for performance problem

**Technical Leadership (for IC3 → IC4):**
- Lead cross-team technical initiative
- Drive architecture decision across multiple services
- Mentor 2-3 engineers on complex project

**Product Sense (for PM IC2 → IC3):**
- Own end-to-end feature from discovery to launch
- Conduct customer discovery for new product area
- Analyze metrics and pivot product direction

**Communication (all roles):**
- Present at company all-hands
- Write RFC or strategy doc
- Run customer meeting or demo

### Timeline
- Small projects: 2-4 weeks
- Medium projects: 2-3 months
- Large initiatives: 6+ months

## Strategy 2: Mentorship

### How to Set Up

**1. Match with right mentor:**
- 1-2 levels above in target skill
- Different team (fresh perspective)
- Strong in skill you want to develop

**2. Set clear goals:**
- "Develop system design skills to IC3 level"
- Not "general mentorship"

**3. Regular cadence:**
- Weekly or bi-weekly 30-min sessions
- 3-6 month commitment

**4. Structure sessions:**
- Week 1: Set goals
- Ongoing: Specific skill practice, review work, Q&A
- Final: Reflect on progress

### Mentorship Formats

**Skill-Building:**
- Mentee shares work, mentor provides feedback
- Practice skill together (e.g., whiteboard system design)
- Mentor shares their approach and thinking

**Career Coaching:**
- Discuss career path and growth
- Navigating org politics
- Leadership development

**Project-Based:**
- Mentee working on project, mentor advises
- Weekly check-ins on progress
- Mentor reviews deliverables

---

## Strategy 3: Formal Training

### When to Use

## Strategy 5: Practice & Repetition

### Deliberate Practice

**Not just doing the work - intentional skill building:**
1. Focus on specific skill
2. Get feedback
3. Reflect on what worked/didn't
4. Iterate

**Example (Improving Presentations):**
- Week 1: Present to team, record it, watch and critique
- Week 2: Present to larger group, get feedback
- Week 3: Present at all-hands, reflect on improvement
- Week 4: Teach presentation skills to junior teammate

### Side Projects

**Benefits:**
- Learn without pressure
- Experiment freely
- Build portfolio

**Ideas:**
- Build personal tool
- Contribute to open source
- Write technical blog
- Speak at meetup

## Development Timeline by Skill Gap

### Small Gap (1 level, e.g., Level 3 → Level 4)

**Timeline:** 3-6 months

**Approach:**
- 1 stretch project
- Monthly mentorship
- On-the-job practice

**Example:**
*Goal: Improve technical communication from L3 to L4*
- Write 2 RFCs (stretch)
- Present at 3 team meetings (practice)
- Mentor from Staff engineer monthly (feedback)

---

### Medium Gap (2 levels, e.g., Level 2 → Level 4)

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Approach:**
- 2-3 stretch projects
- Regular mentorship (weekly or bi-weekly)
- 1-2 courses
- Consistent practice

**Example:**
*Goal: Improve system design from L2 to L4*
- Month 1-2: System design course
- Month 3-5: Design API architecture (project)
- Month 6-9: Design scalable data pipeline (project)
- Month 10-12: Lead architecture for cross-team initiative
- Throughout: Bi-weekly mentorship with Staff engineer

---

### Large Gap (3+ levels or new skill)

**Timeline:** 12-24 months

**Approach:**
- Foundational training first
- Series of progressively harder projects
- Sustained mentorship
- Patience and consistency

**Example:**
*Goal: Develop technical leadership skills (new to IC4 level)*

## Key Principles

1. **Experience > Training:** 70-20-10 rule
2. **Specific Goals:** Not "get better", but "achieve X by Y"
3. **Sustained Practice:** Skill building takes months, not weeks
4. **Feedback Loops:** Regular check-ins and course correction
5. **Manager Support:** Development requires time and resources

Great development strategies turn skill gaps into growth opportunities.
