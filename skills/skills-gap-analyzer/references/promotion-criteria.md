# Promotion Criteria

What's expected at each level for promotion readiness.

---

## General Promotion Principles

### 1. Perform at Next Level BEFORE Promotion

**Don't promote on potential** - promote on demonstrated performance.

**Timeline:** 6-12 months performing at next level consistently

**Why:** Ensures they can sustain performance, not just have a good quarter

---

### 2. Impact Over Time

**Requirements:**
- IC1 → IC2: 12-18 months minimum at IC1
- IC2 → IC3: 18-24 months minimum at IC2
- IC3 → IC4: 24-36 months minimum at IC3
- IC4 → IC5: 36-60+ months minimum at IC4

**Exceptions:** Rare, require exec approval

---

### 3. No Surprises

Promotion should never surprise anyone (candidate or team).

**Process:**
- Ongoing career conversations
- Clear feedback on readiness
- "You're on track for promotion in next cycle"

---

### 4. Performance at Current Level

Must be **exceeding** current level before considering promotion.

If someone is "meets expectations" at current level → not ready yet.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Promoting Too Early

**Problem:** Promote on potential, not proven performance
**Result:** Person struggles at new level, team loses confidence
**Fix:** Require 6-12 months at next level before promoting

---

### Mistake 2: Time-Based Promotions

**Problem:** "You've been here 2 years, here's a promotion"
**Result:** Promotes people who aren't ready
**Fix:** Promote on impact and skills, not tenure

---

### Mistake 3: Retention Promotions

**Problem:** Promote to prevent quitting (panic promotion)
**Result:** Sets bad precedent, not sustainable
**Fix:** If they're threatening to leave and not ready, let them leave

---

### Mistake 4: Title Inflation

**Problem:** Promote to make someone feel good or because "everyone else is Senior"
**Result:** Devalues titles, creates confusion
**Fix:** Maintain high bar, titles should mean something

---

### Mistake 5: Unclear Criteria

**Problem:** No clear expectations for next level
**Result:** Employees confused about what's needed
**Fix:** Document clear criteria, communicate early and often

## Alternative to Promotion: Deepening Expertise

**Not everyone needs to be promoted.**

**Support them by:**
- Pay increases within level
- New challenging projects
- Recognition for expertise
- Flexibility and autonomy

**Title alternatives:**
- Principal IC3 (deep expertise, not scope)
- Senior Staff IC4 (between IC4 and IC5)

Great promotion criteria are clear, consistent, and merit-based - creating fair path for growth.
