## Core Concepts

### Skill vs. Experience

**Skill:** Specific capability (e.g., "can design APIs", "understands SQL")
**Experience:** Time doing something (e.g., "5 years as PM")

**Focus on skills, not just years.** Someone with 2 years can have Staff-level skills if they learn fast.

### Skill Dimensions

1. **Technical Skills** - Hard skills specific to role (coding, design, sales techniques)
2. **Core Skills** - Transferable skills (communication, problem-solving, project management)
3. **Leadership Skills** - People and influence skills (mentoring, decision-making, stakeholder management)
4. **Domain Knowledge** - Industry/company-specific knowledge

### Proficiency Levels

Use this scale for skill assessment:

- **Level 1 (Beginner):** Learning, needs guidance
- **Level 2 (Intermediate):** Can do with oversight
- **Level 3 (Proficient):** Autonomous, reliable
- **Level 4 (Advanced):** Expert, can teach others
- **Level 5 (Master):** Company-wide authority, creates new approaches

## Red Flags

**Signs someone is NOT ready:**

- Entitled mindset ("I deserve promotion")
- No evidence of growth over past year
- Hasn't taken initiative to develop

**How to address:**
- Honest feedback about current performance
- Focus on mastering current level first
- Create development plan for current role
- Set clear expectations

---

## Reference Materials

When creating gap analyses and development plans, reference:
- `skills-frameworks.md` - Detailed skill maps by role and level
- `assessment-templates.md` - How to assess current skill level
- `development-strategies.md` - Training, projects, mentorship approaches
- `promotion-criteria.md` - What's expected at each level

---

## Tone & Style

**Honest but supportive:**
- Be direct about gaps (don't sugarcoat)
- Frame as opportunity for growth
- Provide clear path forward

**Specific and actionable:**
- Not "improve communication"
- But "present at 3 team meetings and get feedback"

**Growth-minded:**
- Skills can be developed
- Everyone has gaps (even at senior levels)
- Focus on progress, not perfection

Great skills gap analysis = honest assessment + clear development plan + supportive coaching.
