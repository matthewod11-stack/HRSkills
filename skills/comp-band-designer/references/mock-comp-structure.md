- Monitor at next review cycle

### Outliers (Outside Band Range)

**Above Maximum:**
- 2 employees (early hires, grandfathered)
  - Engineering Manager: $235K (band max $225K) - justified by performance

## Upcoming Comp Review Cycle (Q2 2024)

**Merit Increase Budget:**
- Pool: 4% of base payroll = $450,000
- Distribution:
  - Exceeds (11 employees): 6% avg = $99,000
  - Meets (55 employees): 4% avg = $330,000
  - Below (7 employees): 0% = $0
  - Remaining: $21,000 for spot adjustments

**Market Adjustments Needed:**
- Engineering IC3: Increase band by $10K (market moved)
  - Impact: 14 employees × $10K avg = $140,000
- Sales AE: Increase band by $15K base (retention risk)
  - Impact: 8 employees × $15K avg = $120,000
- **Total Market Adjustments:** $260,000

**Promotion Budget:**
- Estimated promotions: 9 employees (12% of workforce)
  - IC2 → IC3: 5 employees × $25K avg = $125,000
  - IC3 → IC4: 2 employees × $40K avg = $80,000
  - IC → Manager: 1 employee × $35K = $35,000
  - Manager → Director: 1 employee × $50K = $50,000
- **Total Promotions:** $290,000

**Total Comp Review Budget:**
- Merit: $450,000
- Market adjustments: $260,000
- Promotions: $290,000
- **Total:** $1,000,000 (8.9% increase to base payroll)

## Issues to Address

### 1. Sales Compensation (High Priority)
**Problem:** Losing AEs to competitors, 80% offer acceptance rate (below target)
**Root Cause:** Bands at P40, market is P50-P60 for competitive companies
**Fix:** Increase AE bands by 10-15%, move to P60
**Cost:** ~$120K annually
**Timeline:** Implement in Q2 comp review

### 2. Engineering IC3 Compression (Medium Priority)
**Problem:** New Senior Engineers getting offers at top of band, tenured IC3s feel undervalued
**Root Cause:** Market moved faster than our bands
**Fix:** Increase IC3 band, market adjustments for tenured employees
**Cost:** ~$140K annually
**Timeline:** Q2 comp review

### 3. Equity Pool Running Low (Medium Priority)
**Problem:** Only 39% of option pool remaining, need to hire 25+ people
**Root Cause:** Generous early grants + new hires
**Fix:** Increase option pool (board approval needed)
**Timeline:** Board meeting in Q3

### 4. Geographic Pay Consistency (Low Priority)
**Problem:** Some early remote hires grandfathered at higher rates
**Root Cause:** No geo policy initially, inconsistent offers
**Fix:** Document policy, apply to all new hires, grandfather existing
**Timeline:** Documented, no action needed now

## Use This Data For...

**Testing comp band designer:**
- "Show me the current band for Senior Engineer"
- "We're opening an Austin office, what should we pay?"
- "Design a band for our first Principal Engineer hire"
- "Analyze pay equity in our engineering org"
- "What's our total comp budget impact if we move sales to P70?"

**Realistic Scenarios:**
- New role creation (Staff+ engineers, Directors)
- Geographic expansion (more Austin hires)
- Market adjustments (keep up with competition)
- Pay equity audits
- Comp review planning
