**Total Comp Calculation:**
- Total Comp = Base + Annual Bonus (if applicable) + Annual Equity Value
- Annual Equity Value = Grant Value ÷ 4 years (typical vesting)
- Example: $200K base + $0 bonus + $80K grant/4 = $220K total comp

**Company Stage Adjustments:**
- **Early stage (Seed/A):** -10% to -20% on base, +50% to +100% on equity
- **Growth stage (B/C):** -5% to 0% on base, +20% to +50% on equity
- **Late stage/IPO:** 0% to +5% on base, -20% to 0% on equity (RSUs more liquid)

**Market Movement:**
- Data reflects 2024 market (post-2023 correction)
- Tech salaries cooled from 2021-2022 peaks
- Expect 3-5% annual increases in normal market
- Review benchmarks annually

**Using This Data:**
- Always reference P50 (median) as baseline
- Use P75 for "lead market" strategy
- Use P25 for "lag market" strategy (offset with equity)
- Adjust for company stage, funding, and location
