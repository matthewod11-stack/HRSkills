## Why You Need a Comp Philosophy

**Without one:**
- ❌ Inconsistent offers (managers negotiate differently)
- ❌ Pay equity issues (unexplained gaps by gender/race)

- ❌ Legal risk (discrimination claims)

**With one:**
- ✅ Consistent, defensible pay decisions

## Core Components

### 1. Market Positioning

**The Question:** Where do you want to pay relative to market?

**Options:**

**Lead Market (P75)**
- **Pay:** 75th percentile of market
- **Who:** Top tech companies (FAANG), well-funded startups in competitive roles
- **Pros:** Attract top talent, win offer negotiations, retain high performers
- **Cons:** Expensive, budget pressure, may attract mercenaries
- **When:** Hyper-competitive roles (ML engineers), war for talent

**Match Market (P50)**
- **Pay:** 50th percentile (median)
- **Who:** Most tech companies, balanced approach
- **Pros:** Competitive enough, sustainable, balances cost and talent quality
- **Cons:** Lose some talent to higher payers
- **When:** Standard approach for most roles

**Lag Market (P25)**
- **Pay:** 25th percentile, offset with equity/culture
- **Who:** Early-stage startups, mission-driven orgs
- **Pros:** Budget friendly, attract values-aligned people
- **Cons:** Lose talent to higher payers, longer hiring cycles
- **When:** Early stage with high equity upside

**Blended Approach (Most Common)**
```
Lead: Critical, hard-to-fill roles (ML, senior eng, sales leaders)
Match: Most roles (engineering, product, marketing)
Lag: Junior roles, back-office (offset with equity/culture)
```

### 2. Compensation Mix

**The Question:** How do you balance cash, equity, and benefits?

**By Company Stage:**

**Early Stage (Seed, Series A)**
```
Base Salary: 60-70% (below market)
Equity: 25-35% (large grants)
Bonus: 0-5%
Philosophy: "Get rich, not wealthy" - trade cash for upside
```

**Growth Stage (Series B-C)**
```
Base Salary: 70-80% (moving toward market)
Equity: 15-25% (meaningful but less than early stage)
Bonus: 5-10%
Philosophy: "Balance" - competitive cash + upside
```

**Late Stage (Series D+, Pre-IPO)**
```
Base Salary: 80-90% (at or above market)
Equity: 10-15% (smaller % but more liquid)
Bonus: 5-15%
Philosophy: "Get wealthy" - more cash, less risk
```

**Public Company**
```
Base Salary: 85-95% (market competitive)
Equity (RSUs): 10-20% (liquid, less upside)
Bonus: 10-20%
Philosophy: "Total comp" - balanced package
```

**By Role Type:**

**Sales:**
```
Base: 40-50%
Commission: 40-50%
Equity: 5-10%
Philosophy: Pay for performance, high variable comp
```

**Engineering/Product:**
```
Base: 70-80%
Equity: 15-25%
Bonus: 5-10%
Philosophy: Stability + long-term upside
```

**Executives:**
```
Base: 50-60%
Equity: 30-40%
Bonus: 10-20%
Philosophy: Aligned with long-term company success
```

### 3. Internal Equity

**The Question:** How do you ensure fairness across employees?

**Principles:**

**Equal pay for equal work:**
- Same role, same level, same performance = same pay (within band)
- Account for experience, skills, location
- Cannot discriminate by gender, race, age, etc.

**No compression:**
- Senior levels paid more than junior
- Managers and ICs at same level can overlap (if IC track valued)
- Promotions should result in meaningful increases

**Transparency:**
- Levels and bands documented
- Employees know where they sit in range
- Clear promotion criteria

### 4. Performance Linkage

**The Question:** How does performance affect pay?

**Annual Merit Increases:**
```
Exceeds Expectations: 5-8% raise
Meets Expectations: 3-5% raise
Below Expectations: 0-2% raise (or PIP)
```

**Promotions:**
```
Move to new band minimum (or higher if already above)
Typically 10-20% increase
Should be meaningful, not just title change
```

**Spot Bonuses:**
```
Exceptional project delivery: $5K-$20K
Going above and beyond: $1K-$5K
Peer recognition: $250-$1K
```

**High Performer Retention:**
```
Market adjustments: Bring to P75 of band
Equity refreshes: Additional grants for top performers
Promotion acceleration: Fast-track to next level
```

### 5. Geographic Strategy

**The Question:** How do you pay across locations?

**(See geo-multipliers.md for details)**

**Options:**
- **Location-based:** Different pay by location (most common)
- **Role-based:** Same pay everywhere (expensive, simple)
- **Blended:** Pay at mid-tier for all remote

## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Philosophy

### Step 1: What's your funding stage?

**Seed/Series A:**
→ Lean toward Lag + Equity (preserve cash, attract believers)

**Series B-C:**
→ Match market (balanced, competitive)

**Series D+ / Pre-IPO:**
→ Lead or Match (reduce risk, compete for talent)

### Step 2: What's your talent market?

**Hyper-competitive (AI/ML, senior eng):**
→ Lead market for these roles

**Balanced (most product/eng roles):**
→ Match market

**Less competitive (back-office, junior):**
→ Lag market okay if offset with equity/culture

### Step 3: What's your budget?

**Tight:**
→ Lag + Equity, focus on mission-driven

**Moderate:**
→ Match, blended approach

**Well-funded:**
→ Lead, compete aggressively

### Step 4: What's your culture?

**Mission-driven, high ownership:**
→ Lower cash, higher equity, attract believers

**Performance-driven, meritocratic:**
→ Match/Lead, performance bonuses, fast promotions

**Stable, work-life balance:**
→ Match, less variable comp, good benefits

## Red Flags to Avoid

**❌ "We pay based on what people ask for"**
- Problem: Negotiation skills ≠ performance, creates pay inequity
- Fix: Bands and consistent offers

**❌ "We pay below market because of our mission"**
- Problem: Only works if mission truly compelling + equity valuable
- Fix: Be honest about trade-offs, ensure equity is real upside

**❌ "We don't have a philosophy, we're flexible"**
- Problem: Inconsistency, budget chaos, legal risk
- Fix: Document your approach, even if simple

**❌ "We pay everyone the same to be fair"**
- Problem: Doesn't reward performance, loses high performers
- Fix: Bands allow range, link to performance

**❌ "We'll match any offer to retain people"**
- Problem: Expensive, creates resentment (why didn't I get raise earlier?)
- Fix: Proactive market adjustments, retention for top performers only

## Communicating Your Philosophy

**To Candidates:**
```
"We pay at the 50th percentile (median) of market for your role
and level in [location]. We offset this with meaningful equity
ownership (you're an owner, not just an employee). Our offers are
consistent and fair - we don't negotiate against ourselves."
```

**To Employees:**
```
"Our comp philosophy is to match market (P50) for most roles and
lead (P75) for high-impact positions. We review compensation
annually and make market adjustments as needed. You can view our
band structure [here] and see where you fall in your range."
```

**To Leadership:**
```
"Maintaining our Match philosophy with Lead for critical roles will
require a $2M increase to our comp budget this year based on market
movement. This keeps us competitive and reduces retention risk."
```

## Annual Review Process

**What to Review:**
1. **Market data:** Are benchmarks still accurate? (use Radford, Pave, Carta)
2. **Philosophy fit:** Still matching our intended positioning?
3. **Pay equity:** Any unexplained gaps by gender/race/etc.?
4. **Budget impact:** What does it cost to maintain philosophy?
5. **Attrition:** Losing people to comp? Adjust upward.
6. **Compression:** New hires making more than tenured employees? Fix it.

**Actions:**
- Update bands based on market movement (typically +3-5% annually)
- Make market adjustments for outliers (people below band min)
- Plan merit increase budget (3-5% of payroll)
- Communicate changes to leadership, then employees

## Final Thoughts

**Your comp philosophy should be:**
- ✅ **Documented:** Written down, not just in someone's head
- ✅ **Communicated:** Employees and candidates understand it
- ✅ **Consistent:** Applied fairly across all employees
- ✅ **Reviewed:** Updated annually based on market and budget
- ✅ **Defensible:** Can explain why someone is paid X
- ✅ **Aligned:** Matches your culture, stage, and budget

**Remember:**
- Comp is just one part of total rewards (culture, growth, impact matter)
- Transparency builds trust (even if you can't pay top of market)
- Equity matters more than you think (especially early stage)
- Consistency > flexibility (prevents chaos and legal risk)
- Pay people fairly, or lose them to someone who will
