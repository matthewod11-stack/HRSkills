## Best Practices Recap

1. **Keep it focused:** Every question should have a purpose (actionable insight)

2. **Balance quantity and quality:** More questions = more data, but lower response rates

3. **Use consistent scales:** Stick to 5-point Likert or 1-5 rating throughout survey

4. **Limit open-ended questions:** 2-3 max (time-consuming to answer and analyze)

5. **Test before launch:** Pilot with 5-10 people, get feedback on clarity and length

6. **Make it anonymous:** Unless 1:1 feedback (like 360), anonymity drives honest responses

7. **Benchmark over time:** Ask same core questions each year to track trends

**Great surveys = focused questions, respectful of time, designed for action.**
