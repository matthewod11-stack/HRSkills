# Action Planning Framework

Complete guide to translating survey insights into concrete action plans that drive organizational change.

---

## Overview: From Insights to Action

**The bridge:**
```
Survey Results → Prioritization → Root Cause Analysis → SMART Actions → Ownership → Implementation → Measurement
```

**Common failure mode:**
- ❌ Share survey results → "Thanks for feedback!" → Nothing changes → Next year's survey response rate tanks

**Success model:**
- ✅ Share results → Prioritized action plan → Clear owners → Execute → Measure impact → Communicate progress

---

## Step 1: Prioritization

**You can't fix everything. Prioritize ruthlessly.**

---

### The 2x2 Prioritization Matrix

**Axes:**
- **X-axis:** Impact on engagement (Low → High)
- **Y-axis:** Current score (High → Low)

**Quadrants:**

|                     | Low Impact | High Impact |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Low Score (Problem)** | 🟡 Nice to have | 🔴 **PRIORITY 1** |
| **High Score (Strength)** | ⚪ Maintain | 🟢 Protect |

---

**🔴 Priority 1: High Impact + Low Score**
- **Action:** Fix these first (biggest ROI)
- **Example:** Career development (45% favorable, 0.75 correlation to eNPS)

**🟢 Protect: High Impact + High Score**
- **Action:** Don't break what's working (keep doing it)
- **Example:** Manager effectiveness (85% favorable, 0.72 correlation to eNPS)

**🟡 Nice to have: Low Impact + Low Score**
- **Action:** Deprioritize (won't move engagement)
- **Example:** Office comfort (50% favorable, 0.20 correlation to eNPS)

**⚪ Maintain: Low Impact + High Score**
- **Action:** No change needed
- **Example:** Free snacks (80% favorable, 0.10 correlation to eNPS)

---

### Example: Prioritization Exercise

**Survey results:**

| Issue | Score | Correlation to eNPS | Quadrant | Priority |
|-------|-------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Career development | 45% | 0.75 (high) | 🔴 High impact, low score | **1st** |
| Manager effectiveness | 85% | 0.72 (high) | 🟢 High impact, high score | Protect |
| Workload/burnout | 60% | 0.65 (moderate-high) | 🔴 High impact, low score | **2nd** |
| Compensation transparency | 55% | 0.55 (moderate) | 🟡 Moderate impact, low score | **3rd** |
| Recognition | 65% | 0.60 (moderate) | 🟡 Moderate impact, moderate score | 4th |
| Office comfort | 50% | 0.20 (low) | 🟡 Low impact, low score | Deprioritize |

**Action plan priority order:**
1. 🔴 Career development (biggest gap, highest impact)
2. 🔴 Workload/burnout (high impact, clear problem)
3. 🟡 Compensation transparency (moderate impact, moderate gap)
4. _(Deprioritize office comfort - low impact)_

---

### The 3-5 Rule

**Pick 3-5 top priorities. No more.**

**Why?**
- **Trying to fix 10 things = fixing nothing** (diluted resources, no accountability)
- **Focus on 3-5 = real progress** (concentrated effort, clear ownership)

**Exception:** If you have segmented issues (e.g., Operations department crisis), create department-specific action plan.

---

## Step 2: Root Cause Analysis

**Don't treat symptoms. Find root causes.**

---

### The 5 Whys Technique

**Example 1: Career Development**

**Problem:** "I have opportunities for career growth" = 45% favorable

**5 Whys:**
1. **Why is career growth scored low?**
   - "Employees don't see promotion opportunities"

2. **Why don't they see promotion opportunities?**
   - "No clear criteria for promotion (what does it take to get promoted?)"

3. **Why don't we have clear promotion criteria?**
   - "We never documented career ladders"

4. **Why haven't we documented career ladders?**
   - "Company grew fast (30 → 250 employees in 2 years), systems didn't keep up"

5. **Why didn't systems keep up?**
   - "HR is under-resourced (1 HRBP for 250 employees)"

**Root cause:** HR capacity issue + lack of documented career frameworks

**Solutions:**
- **Short-term:** Train managers to have career conversations with their teams (even without formal ladders)
- **Medium-term:** Hire HR to build career ladders (or contract with external consultant)
- **Long-term:** Build career development into performance review process

---

**Example 2: Manager Effectiveness (Specific Team)**

**Problem:** Linda's team (Operations) scored 30% on "My manager is effective"

**5 Whys:**
1. **Why is Linda's team unhappy with her management?**
   - "Employees say she doesn't provide clear direction"

2. **Why doesn't she provide clear direction?**
   - "She's new to management (promoted 6 months ago from IC)"

3. **Why was she promoted without management training?**
   - "We promote based on technical skill, not management readiness"

4. **Why do we promote based on technical skill?**
   - "No formal criteria for what makes a good manager"

5. **Why don't we have criteria for good managers?**
   - "Company hasn't defined leadership competencies"

**Root cause:** Linda is undertrained + company promotes ICs without preparing them for management

**Solutions:**
- **Immediate:** Provide Linda with manager coaching (executive coach or internal mentor)
- **Short-term:** Enroll Linda in manager training program
- **Long-term:** Create manager readiness criteria + require training before promotion to management

---

### Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram

**Alternative root cause method (visual):**

**Problem:** Workload/burnout scored 60% favorable

**Categories (fishbone):**
- **People:** Headcount hasn't kept up with growth
- **Process:** No process to say "no" to new projects (everything is top priority)
- **Tools:** Inefficient tools slow down work
- **Culture:** "Always-on" culture (emails at 10pm, weekend Slack messages)
- **Leadership:** Executives keep adding initiatives without removing old ones

**Root causes identified:**
1. Headcount gap (People)
2. Lack of prioritization (Process)
3. Culture of overwork (Culture)

**Solutions:**
- Accelerate hiring (People)
- Implement project prioritization framework (Process)
- Leadership models work-life balance (Culture)

---

## Step 3: Define SMART Actions

**Every action must be:**
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ssignable (who owns it)
- **R**ealistic
- **T**ime-bound

---

### Template: SMART Action Plan

**Goal:** Improve [metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]

**Actions:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Metric |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Specific action] | [Name] | [Date] | [Measurable outcome] |

---

### Example 1: Career Development Action Plan

**Goal:** Improve "I have opportunities for career growth" from 45% to 65% favorable within 12 months

**Actions:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Metric |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Create career ladders for all roles (Eng, Sales, Ops, Support) | VP of People | Q2 2025 | 100% of roles have documented career path |
| 2 | Train all managers on career conversation framework | L&D | Q1 2025 | 100% of managers (25 people) complete training |
| 3 | Require career discussion in all quarterly 1:1s | All Managers | Ongoing (starting Q2) | 80% of employees report discussing career in next survey |
| 4 | Launch "Lunch & Learn" skill development series (bi-weekly) | L&D | Q2 2025 | 50% employee attendance (avg across sessions) |
| 5 | Publish internal mobility policy (make it easy to switch teams) | VP of People | Q2 2025 | Policy published on internal wiki |
| 6 | Measure progress in Q3 pulse survey | VP of People | Q3 2025 | Career development score improves to 60%+ (interim goal) |

---

### Example 2: Workload/Burnout Action Plan

**Goal:** Improve "My workload is reasonable and manageable" from 60% to 75% favorable within 9 months

**Actions:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Metric |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Conduct workload audit (survey teams on project load) | VP of Ops | Month 1 | Audit complete, report to leadership |
| 2 | Accelerate hiring to close headcount gap (12 open roles) | Recruiting | Q2 2025 | 10 of 12 roles filled |
| 3 | Implement project prioritization framework (use RICE scoring) | Product + Eng Leads | Month 2 | Framework adopted, all projects scored |
| 4 | Kill bottom 20% of projects (lowest RICE scores) | CEO | Month 3 | 5 low-value projects cancelled |
| 5 | Institute "No Meeting Fridays" for deep work | CEO | Month 1 | Policy in place, <5 meetings scheduled on Fridays |
| 6 | Leadership models work-life balance (no emails after 6pm) | Exec Team | Ongoing | Execs commit publicly, track compliance |
| 7 | Measure progress in Q2 pulse survey | VP of People | Q2 2025 | Workload score improves to 70%+ |

---

### Example 3: Manager Effectiveness (Linda's Team)

**Goal:** Improve Linda's team engagement from 45% to 70% favorable within 6 months

**Actions:**

| # | Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Metric |
|---|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Assign Linda an executive coach (weekly sessions) | VP of Ops | Month 1 | Coach engaged, 6-month contract signed |
| 2 | Linda completes manager training program (8-week course) | Linda | Month 3 | Training completed, certification earned |
| 3 | VP of Ops conducts team focus group (gather feedback on what team needs) | VP of Ops | Month 1 | Focus group complete, themes identified |
| 4 | Linda implements weekly team meetings (clear updates, Q&A) | Linda | Ongoing | Weekly meetings held (track attendance) |
| 5 | Linda holds 1:1s with all 15 team members (bi-weekly) | Linda | Ongoing | 100% of team has bi-weekly 1:1 |
| 6 | VP of Ops shadows Linda's 1:1s (provide real-time coaching) | VP of Ops | Months 1-3 | 3 shadow sessions complete, feedback given |
| 7 | Measure progress via team pulse survey | VP of People | Month 6 | Team engagement improves to 65%+ |

**Contingency:** If no improvement by Month 6, consider moving Linda back to IC role and hiring experienced manager.

---

## Step 4: Assign Ownership

**Every action needs a directly responsible individual (DRI).**

---

### Ownership Roles

**1. Executive Sponsor**
- **Role:** Remove roadblocks, allocate budget, hold DRI accountable
- **Example:** CEO sponsors "Career Development" action plan (signals importance)

**2. Directly Responsible Individual (DRI)**
- **Role:** Does the work, drives execution, reports progress
- **Example:** VP of People is DRI for creating career ladders

**3. Contributors**
- **Role:** Support the DRI (subject matter experts, cross-functional partners)
- **Example:** Department heads help define role-specific career competencies

---

### Example: Ownership Chart

**Action:** Create career ladders for all roles

| Role | Name | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Executive Sponsor** | CEO | Approves framework, allocates $50K budget, quarterly check-ins |
| **DRI** | VP of People | Leads design, coordinates with dept heads, delivers final career ladders |
| **Contributors** | VP Eng, VP Sales, VP Ops | Define competencies for their departments |
| **Contributors** | L&D Manager | Designs training to support career paths |

---

### RACI Matrix (Optional)

**For complex projects, use RACI:**
- **R**esponsible: Does the work (DRI)
- **A**ccountable: Final decision-maker (Executive Sponsor)
- **C**onsulted: Provides input (Contributors)
- **I**nformed: Kept in the loop (stakeholders)

**Example: Career Ladders Project**

| Task | VP People | CEO | Dept Heads | L&D | Employees |
|------|-----------|-----|------------|-----|-----------|
| Define framework | R | A | C | C | I |
| Get dept input | R | I | C | I | I |
| Finalize ladders | R | A | I | I | I |
| Communicate ladders | R | I | I | R | I |
| Train managers | C | I | I | R | I |

---

## Step 5: Create Action Plan Timeline

**Visualize when actions will happen:**

---

### Example: 12-Month Action Plan Timeline

**Priority 1: Career Development**

| Quarter | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| **Q1** | - Train managers on career conversations (Jan)<br>- Conduct career development focus groups (Feb)<br>- Draft career ladder framework (Mar) |
| **Q2** | - Finalize career ladders for all roles (Apr)<br>- Launch internal mobility policy (May)<br>- Launch "Lunch & Learn" series (Jun) |
| **Q3** | - Career discussions required in all 1:1s (ongoing)<br>- Measure progress via pulse survey (Aug) |
| **Q4** | - Refine career ladders based on feedback (Oct)<br>- Annual survey (Nov) - measure full-year impact |

**Milestone:** Career development score improves from 45% → 60% (Q3 pulse) → 65% (Q4 annual survey)

---

**Priority 2: Workload/Burnout**

| Quarter | Actions |
|---------|---------|
| **Q1** | - Workload audit complete (Jan)<br>- Project prioritization framework (Feb)<br>- Kill low-value projects (Mar)<br>- Accelerate hiring |
| **Q2** | - Continue hiring (fill 10 of 12 roles)<br>- No Meeting Fridays policy (ongoing)<br>- Measure progress via pulse survey (Jun) |
| **Q3-Q4** | - Monitor workload metrics (overtime, burnout signals)<br>- Annual survey (Nov) |

**Milestone:** Workload score improves from 60% → 70% (Q2 pulse) → 75% (Q4 annual survey)

---

## Step 6: Implementation Playbook

**How to actually execute the action plan:**

---

### Week 1-2: Finalize Action Plan

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Review survey results with leadership
- [ ] Prioritize top 3-5 issues
- [ ] Draft SMART actions
- [ ] Assign owners (get commitments)
- [ ] Get CEO approval and sponsorship

**Deliverable:** Final action plan document

---

### Week 3: Communicate Results + Action Plan

**Tasks:**
- [ ] CEO sends company-wide email with survey results + action plan
- [ ] Host all-hands to present results (transparency)
- [ ] Managers receive team-level reports + guide for discussing with teams
- [ ] Post action plan on internal wiki (visible to all)

**Template:** See `survey-communication-templates.md`

---

### Month 1-3: Execute Quick Wins

**Why quick wins?** Build momentum and trust ("they're actually doing something!")

**Examples of quick wins:**
- ✅ Launch "No Meeting Fridays" (immediate relief)
- ✅ Cancel 3 low-value projects (immediate workload reduction)
- ✅ Publish internal mobility policy (shows commitment to career growth)
- ✅ CEO commits to no emails after 6pm (leadership models balance)

**Avoid:** Long-term initiatives with no visible progress for 6+ months (employees lose faith)

---

### Ongoing: Track Progress

**Monthly check-ins:**
- [ ] Action owners report progress (green/yellow/red status)
- [ ] Escalate blockers to executive sponsors
- [ ] Update company on progress (monthly email or all-hands update)

**Dashboard example:**

| Action | Owner | Status | % Complete | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| Create career ladders | VP People | 🟢 On track | 60% | Eng ladder done, Sales/Ops in progress |
| Manager training | L&D | 🟢 On track | 100% | All 25 managers trained ✅ |
| Hiring (12 roles) | Recruiting | 🟡 At risk | 50% | 6 of 12 filled, pipeline strong |
| Project prioritization | Product | 🟢 On track | 100% | Framework adopted, 5 projects killed ✅ |

---

### Quarter 2-3: Pulse Survey Check-In

**Why pulse survey?** Measure interim progress (don't wait 12 months)

**Pulse survey (5-10 questions):**
- "I have opportunities for career growth" (re-ask from annual survey)
- "My workload is reasonable and manageable"
- "I see progress on issues raised in the last survey" ← **Key question**

**Expected result:**
- Career development: 45% → 60% (progress, not perfect)
- Workload: 60% → 70%
- "I see progress": 75%+ (shows actions are working)

**If no improvement:** Revisit action plan, adjust strategy

---

### Month 12: Annual Survey (Measure Impact)

**Full annual survey to measure year-over-year change:**

| Metric | 2024 Baseline | 2025 Target | 2025 Actual | Status |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Career development | 45% | 65% | 68% | ✅ Exceeded |
| Workload/burnout | 60% | 75% | 72% | 🟡 Close (not quite) |
| Overall engagement | 70% | 75% | 76% | ✅ Exceeded |
| eNPS | +25 | +35 | +38 | ✅ Exceeded |

**Celebrate wins, adjust for gaps, plan Year 2 actions.**

---

## Step 7: Avoid Common Pitfalls

---

### Pitfall 1: Boiling the ocean

**Mistake:** Try to fix every survey issue (20+ action items)

**Why it fails:** Diluted resources, no clear ownership, nothing gets done

**Fix:** Pick 3-5 top priorities, execute them well

---

### Pitfall 2: Vague actions

**Mistake:**
- ❌ "Improve career development"
- ❌ "Better communication"
- ❌ "Increase engagement"

**Why it fails:** No one knows what to do, no accountability

**Fix:** SMART actions
- ✅ "Create career ladders for all roles by Q2 (Owner: VP People)"
- ✅ "Train 25 managers on career conversations by Q1 (Owner: L&D)"

---

### Pitfall 3: No ownership

**Mistake:** "HR will handle survey action items"

**Why it fails:** HR can't fix workload, compensation, or manager quality alone (these are business issues, not HR issues)

**Fix:** Assign business owners
- Career development → VP of People + Department Heads
- Workload → VP of Operations + Hiring
- Manager quality → Managers' managers (coaching)

---

### Pitfall 4: Action plan sits in drawer

**Mistake:** Create action plan, then forget about it

**Why it fails:** No progress, employees lose trust

**Fix:**
- Monthly progress updates (dashboard, all-hands)
- Quarterly pulse survey to measure impact
- Tie action plan to executive goals/OKRs (make it a priority)

---

### Pitfall 5: No quick wins

**Mistake:** All actions are 12-month initiatives (e.g., "Build new career framework")

**Why it fails:** Employees don't see progress, lose faith

**Fix:** Mix of quick wins (1-3 months) and long-term initiatives
- **Quick wins:** No Meeting Fridays, cancel low-value projects, CEO commits to work-life balance
- **Long-term:** Career ladders, comp bands, manager training program

---

## Step 8: Measuring ROI of Actions

**How do you know if your actions worked?**

---

### Method 1: Survey Score Improvement

**Before/after comparison:**

| Metric | Before Action | After Action (12 months) | Change |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Career development | 45% favorable | 68% favorable | +23 points ✅ |
| eNPS | +25 | +38 | +13 points ✅ |

**Insight:** Career development actions worked (23-point improvement)

---

### Method 2: Business Impact

**Example: Manager Training Program**

**Investment:**
- Manager training: $50K (external program for 25 managers)
- Time cost: 25 managers × 40 hours = 1,000 hours (~$50K in salary)
- **Total cost: $100K**

**Impact (12 months later):**
- Manager effectiveness score: 75% → 85% (+10 points)
- Turnover (manager-related): 15% → 8% (-7 points)
- Employees retained: 17 (7% of 250 employees)

**Financial benefit:**
- Cost to replace 1 employee: $30K (recruiting + onboarding + lost productivity)
- Benefit: 17 employees × $30K = $510K

**ROI:**
```
ROI = ($510K - $100K) / $100K × 100% = 410%

For every $1 spent on manager training, company saved $5.10
```

---

### Method 3: Retention Analysis

**Track whether survey respondents stay or leave:**

**Example:**

| Group | 12-Month Retention Rate |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Promoters (eNPS 9-10) | 95% ✅ |
| Passives (eNPS 7-8) | 85% 🟡 |
| Detractors (eNPS 0-6) | 60% ❌ |

**Insight:** Detractors are 35 points more likely to leave (95% - 60%)

**Action:** If you improve engagement (convert Detractors → Passives/Promoters), you reduce turnover

**Financial impact:**
- 40 Detractors (20% of 200 employees)
- If 40% of Detractors leave: 16 employees quit
- Cost to replace 16 employees: 16 × $30K = $480K

**If action plan converts half of Detractors → Passives:**
- Detractors: 40 → 20
- Turnover: 16 → 8 employees quit
- **Savings: 8 × $30K = $240K**

## Templates

### Template 1: One-Page Action Plan

**Survey Results: Annual Engagement Survey 2024**

**Response Rate:** 240/300 (80%) ✅

**Top 3 Priorities:**

---

**Priority 1: Career Development** (45% favorable → Target: 65%)

**Root Cause:** No clear career paths or promotion criteria

**Actions:**
1. Create career ladders (Owner: VP People, Q2 2025)
2. Train managers on career conversations (Owner: L&D, Q1 2025)
3. Launch Lunch & Learn series (Owner: L&D, Q2 2025)

**Success Metric:** Career development score 65%+ by annual survey (Nov 2025)

---

**Priority 2: Workload/Burnout** (60% favorable → Target: 75%)

**Root Cause:** Headcount gap + lack of prioritization

**Actions:**
1. Hire 10 of 12 open roles (Owner: Recruiting, Q2 2025)
2. Kill bottom 20% of projects (Owner: CEO, Month 3)
3. Institute No Meeting Fridays (Owner: CEO, Month 1)

**Success Metric:** Workload score 75%+ by annual survey (Nov 2025)

---

**Priority 3: Compensation Transparency** (55% favorable → Target: 70%)

**Root Cause:** Employees don't understand how pay decisions are made

**Actions:**
1. Publish compensation philosophy (Owner: VP People, Q1 2025)
2. Create pay bands for all roles (Owner: VP People, Q2 2025)
3. Train managers to discuss comp transparently (Owner: L&D, Q2 2025)

**Success Metric:** Comp transparency score 70%+ by annual survey (Nov 2025)

---

**Next Steps:**
- **Week 1:** Share results + action plan with company (all-hands)
- **Monthly:** Track progress (dashboard shared at all-hands)
- **Q3:** Pulse survey to measure interim progress
