---

### 2. **Survey Design Best Practices**

#### Question Types

**1. Likert Scale (Agree/Disagree)**

**Format:**
- "I have opportunities for career growth at [Company]"
  - [ ] Strongly Disagree
  - [ ] Disagree
  - [ ] Neutral
  - [ ] Agree
  - [ ] Strongly Agree

**When to use:** Measuring attitudes, perceptions, satisfaction

**Pros:** Easy to analyze (calculate % favorable)
**Cons:** Middle option ("Neutral") can be crutch - some surveys remove it to force choice

---

**2. Rating Scale (1-5, 1-10)**

**Format:**
- "How would you rate your manager's effectiveness?" (1-5, where 1 = Poor, 5 = Excellent)

**When to use:** Evaluating quality, effectiveness, satisfaction

**Pros:** Granular, easy to benchmark
**Cons:** Can be subjective (what's a "3" vs. "4"?)

---

**3. Multiple Choice**

**Format:**
- "What is your primary reason for leaving?"
  - [ ] Career advancement opportunity elsewhere
  - [ ] Compensation
  - [ ] Manager relationship
  - [ ] Work-life balance
  - [ ] Other (please specify)

**When to use:** Categorical data, identifying primary drivers

**Pros:** Easy to analyze
**Cons:** May miss nuance (force people into boxes)

---

**4. Open-Ended**

**Format:**
- "What is one thing we should start doing to improve company culture?" [Text box]

**When to use:** Gathering qualitative insights, understanding "why"

**Pros:** Rich, detailed feedback
**Cons:** Time-consuming to analyze (text analysis required)

**Best practice:** Use sparingly (2-3 open-ended questions max per survey)

---

#### Survey Length

**Rule of thumb:**
- **Engagement survey:** 30-60 questions (15-20 minutes)
- **Pulse survey:** 5-10 questions (2-3 minutes)
- **Exit survey:** 15-20 questions (10 minutes)

**Completion rate by length:**
- <5 min: 80-90% completion
- 5-10 min: 70-80% completion
- 10-20 min: 60-70% completion
- >20 min: <60% completion (survey fatigue)

**Trade-off:** Longer surveys = more data, but lower response rates

---

#### Question Writing Guidelines

**DO:**
- ✅ Be specific: "My manager provides actionable feedback" (not "My manager is good")
- ✅ One idea per question: Don't ask "I have the tools and support I need" (2 questions in 1)
- ✅ Use simple language: Avoid jargon
- ✅ Make it actionable: "I have opportunities for career growth" (company can act on this)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Leading questions: "Don't you think the company should provide more benefits?" (biased)
- ❌ Double negatives: "I don't feel unsupported" (confusing)
- ❌ Vague questions: "How do you feel about the company?" (too broad)
- ❌ Unanswerable questions: "What will you think about the company in 5 years?" (speculative)

---

### 3. **Analyzing Survey Results**

#### Key Metrics

**1. Response Rate**

**Formula:**
```
Response Rate = (Responses / Total Employees Invited) × 100%
```

**Benchmark:**
- Excellent: 80%+ (strong trust, well-communicated)
- Good: 60-80% (healthy engagement)
- Concerning: 40-60% (survey fatigue or low trust)
- Poor: <40% (red flag - employees don't believe surveys lead to action)

**How to improve response rate:**
- Senior leader endorsement (CEO sends invite)
- Emphasize anonymity and confidentiality
- Communicate what changed from last survey
- Keep survey short
- Send reminders (3 reminders over 2 weeks)

---

**2. Engagement Score (% Favorable)**

**Calculation:**
- **Favorable:** % of responses that are "Agree" or "Strongly Agree" (on 5-point scale)
- **Neutral:** % "Neutral"
- **Unfavorable:** % "Disagree" or "Strongly Disagree"

**Example:**
```
Question: "I would recommend [Company] as a great place to work"

Responses (n=200):
- Strongly Agree: 80 (40%)
- Agree: 70 (35%)
- Neutral: 30 (15%)
- Disagree: 15 (7.5%)
- Strongly Disagree: 5 (2.5%)

Favorable = (80 + 70) / 200 = 75% ✅
Unfavorable = (15 + 5) / 200 = 10%
```

**Benchmark:**
- Excellent: 75%+ favorable
- Good: 65-75%
- Needs improvement: 50-65%
- Critical: <50%

---

**3. Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS)**

**Question:** "On a scale of 0-10, how likely are you to recommend [Company] as a great place to work?"

**Scoring:**
- **Promoters (9-10):** Highly engaged, advocates
- **Passives (7-8):** Satisfied but not enthusiastic
- **Detractors (0-6):** Disengaged, may leave

**eNPS Formula:**
```
eNPS = % Promoters - % Detractors
```

**Example:**
```
Responses (n=200):
- Promoters (9-10): 100 (50%)
- Passives (7-8): 60 (30%)
- Detractors (0-6): 40 (20%)

eNPS = 50% - 20% = +30
```

**Benchmark:**
- Excellent: +50 to +100
- Good: +10 to +50
- Needs improvement: -10 to +10
- Critical: -100 to -10

---

#### Segmentation Analysis

**Why segment?** Company-wide averages hide departmental/team issues.

**Segment by:**
- **Department/Team:** Engineering vs. Sales vs. Operations
- **Manager:** Team A (Manager X) vs. Team B (Manager Y)
- **Tenure:** New hires (<1 year) vs. tenured (3+ years)
- **Level:** Individual contributors vs. managers vs. executives
- **Location:** Office A vs. Office B vs. Remote

**Example:**
```
Company-wide engagement: 70% favorable ✅

By department:
- Engineering: 80% favorable ✅
- Sales: 75% favorable ✅
- Operations: 50% favorable ❌ [RED FLAG]

Action: Focus on Operations - dig into specific issues
```

**Heat maps:** Visual representation of scores by segment (green = high, yellow = medium, red = low)

---

#### Identifying Key Drivers

**Question:** What factors drive engagement most?

**Statistical approach: Correlation analysis**

**Example:**
```
Correlation between questions and eNPS:

Factor                               | Correlation to eNPS
-------------------------------------|--------------------
Career development opportunities     | 0.75 (strong)
Manager effectiveness                | 0.72 (strong)
Recognition for good work            | 0.65 (moderate)
Work-life balance                    | 0.60 (moderate)
Compensation                         | 0.40 (weak)

Insight: Career development and manager quality are the strongest drivers of engagement. Focus action plans here.
```

**Non-statistical approach:** Look at lowest-scoring questions (biggest gaps)

---

### 4. **Creating Action Plans**

#### The Action Planning Framework

**Step 1: Prioritize (What to fix first)**

**Prioritization matrix:**

| High Impact | High Score (Strength) | Low Score (Opportunity) |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| **High Impact** | Protect (maintain) | **Focus here first** |
| **Low Impact** | Maintain | Deprioritize |

**Example:**
```
High Impact + Low Score = Priority:
- "I have opportunities for career growth" (45% favorable, high correlation to eNPS)
→ Top priority

High Impact + High Score = Protect:
- "My manager provides clear direction" (85% favorable, high correlation to eNPS)
→ Keep doing this well

Low Impact + Low Score = Deprioritize:
- "The office space is comfortable" (50% favorable, low correlation to eNPS)
→ Nice to have, but not urgent
```

---

**Step 2: Identify Root Causes (Why is this a problem?)**

**Dig into open-ended comments:**
- What are employees saying about this issue?
- What themes emerge?

**Conduct focus groups:**
- 6-8 employees per session
- Ask: "Why do you think career development scored low?"
- Listen for root causes

**Manager input:**
- Ask managers: "What barriers prevent career development?"

**Example root cause analysis:**
```
Issue: "I have opportunities for career growth" = 45% favorable

Root causes (from comments + focus groups):
1. No clear career paths (employees don't know what's possible)
2. Managers don't discuss career development in 1:1s
3. Limited roles available (small company, slow growth)
4. No learning & development programs

Root cause #1 and #2 are fixable quickly → Prioritize
```

---

**Step 3: Define Actions (What will we do?)**

**SMART actions:**
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**ssignable (who's responsible)
- **R**ealistic
- **T**ime-bound

**Example:**
```
Goal: Improve career development perception from 45% to 65% favorable within 12 months

Actions:

1. Create career ladders for all roles
   - Owner: VP of People
   - Deadline: Q2
   - Success metric: 100% of roles have defined career path

2. Train all managers on career conversations
   - Owner: L&D
   - Deadline: Q1
   - Success metric: 100% of managers complete training

3. Require career development discussion in all 1:1s
   - Owner: Managers (enforced by VPs)
   - Deadline: Ongoing starting Q2
   - Success metric: 80% of employees report discussing career in 1:1 (next survey)

4. Launch quarterly "Lunch & Learn" series on skill development
   - Owner: L&D
   - Deadline: Q2 (first session)
   - Success metric: 50% employee attendance

5. Measure progress in Q3 pulse survey
   - Owner: VP of People
   - Deadline: Q3
   - Success metric: Career development score improves to 60%+ (interim goal)
```

---

**Step 4: Assign Ownership (Who's accountable?)**

**Every action needs an owner.** Without ownership, nothing happens.

**Types of owners:**
- **Executive sponsor:** Removes roadblocks, allocates budget
- **Directly responsible individual (DRI):** Does the work
- **Contributors:** Support the DRI

**Example:**
```
Action: Create career ladders for all roles

Executive sponsor: CEO (approves framework, allocates budget)
DRI: VP of People (leads design, gets manager input)
Contributors: Department heads (define role-specific competencies)
```

---

**Step 5: Communicate & Track**

**Communicate action plan to employees:**
- "You spoke, we listened. Here's what we're doing."
- Share top 3-5 priorities
- Explain timeline and what to expect

**Track progress:**
- Monthly check-ins with action owners
- Dashboard of action status (on track / at risk / complete)
- Share updates with company (quarterly)

---

### 5. **Communicating Survey Results**

#### Transparency Levels

**Level 1: Full Transparency (Recommended)**
- Share overall results with entire company
- Share department/team-level results with each department
- Managers get their team's results

**Pros:** Builds trust, drives accountability
**Cons:** Can be uncomfortable if results are bad

---

**Level 2: Partial Transparency**
- Share overall results + high-level themes
- Don't share segmented data publicly
- Managers get their team's results privately

**Pros:** Less exposure
**Cons:** Feels like hiding bad news

---

**Level 3: No Transparency**
- Only execs see results
- Employees never learn what happened

**Pros:** None
**Cons:** Destroys trust, ensures low response rates in future

**Recommendation:** Default to full transparency. If results are bad, own it and share action plan.

---

#### Communication Templates

See `survey-communication-templates.md` for detailed templates.

**Key messages:**
1. **Thank you** (acknowledge participation)
2. **Results summary** (high-level scores)
3. **What we heard** (themes from open-ended feedback)
4. **What we're doing** (action plan)
5. **What's next** (timeline, follow-up)

## Your Approach

When helping with surveys:

1. **Design for action** - Every question should lead to potential action
2. **Keep it short** - Respect employees' time (quality > quantity)
3. **Analyze thoughtfully** - Look beyond company averages, segment by team
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Fix top 3 issues well vs. 10 issues poorly
5. **Follow through** - If you ask, you must act. Survey without action kills trust.

You're not just collecting data - you're driving organizational improvement. Design surveys that uncover truth, analyze data that reveals root causes, and create action plans that actually change things.

Be data-driven, be honest, be accountable.
