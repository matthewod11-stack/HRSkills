## Summary Insights

### What's Working ✅
- Team quality and mission are strengths
- Veterans (2+ years) are still engaged
- Performance distribution is healthy
- Product is resonating with customers

### What's Broken 🚨
- Compensation not competitive (driving flight risk)
- Career paths unclear (losing mid-level talent)
- Burnout risk (esp. high performers)
- Ops & G&A in crisis (eNPS -20)
- Downward trend in multiple segments

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Retention:** Address Sarah Chen + Morgan Taylor comp THIS WEEK
2. **Career Framework:** Launch IC/Manager leveling + promotion criteria
3. **Ops Fix:** Diagnose and address Ops team issues
4. **Workload:** Hire faster or reduce scope to prevent burnout
5. **Communication:** Increase transparency, address uncertainty

### Budget Impact
- Comp adjustments for flight risks: ~$100-150K
