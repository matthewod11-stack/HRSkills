# Accessibility Checklist

Practical guide to making your workplace inclusive for employees with disabilities.

---

## Why Accessibility Matters

**The Statistics:**
- **1 in 4 adults in the U.S. has a disability** (CDC)
- **Many disabilities are invisible:** Chronic illness, mental health, neurodivergence, learning disabilities

**The Business Case:**
- **Larger talent pool:** 15% of the global population has a disability
- **Legal compliance:** ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requires reasonable accommodations
- **Innovation:** Accessibility features benefit everyone (curb cuts, voice assistants, captions)

**The Right Thing to Do:**
- Equal access to employment opportunities
- Dignity and respect for all employees

---

## Types of Disabilities

### Visible Disabilities
- **Mobility:** Wheelchair users, crutches, walkers
- **Vision:** Blind or low vision
- **Hearing:** Deaf or hard of hearing

### Invisible Disabilities
- **Chronic illness:** Fibromyalgia, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, autoimmune conditions
- **Mental health:** Depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder
- **Neurodivergence:** ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia
- **Cognitive:** Traumatic brain injury, dementia, learning disabilities
- **Chronic conditions:** Diabetes, epilepsy, Crohn's disease, migraines

**Key Point:** Don't assume you know who has a disability. Many are invisible.

---

## The ADA and Reasonable Accommodations

### What the ADA Requires

**Covered Employers:** 15+ employees (federal law; some states have lower thresholds)

**Core Requirements:**
1. **Non-discrimination:** Can't refuse to hire or promote someone because of a disability
2. **Reasonable accommodations:** Must provide accommodations unless they cause "undue hardship"
3. **Accessible workplaces:** Physical spaces must be accessible (ramps, elevators, accessible restrooms)

---

### What Is a "Reasonable Accommodation"?

**Definition:** A modification to the work environment or job duties that enables an employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of the job.

**Examples:**
- Flexible work schedule (e.g., work from home for chronic illness)
- Modified workspace (e.g., standing desk, ergonomic chair)
- Assistive technology (e.g., screen reader, voice-to-text software)
- Quiet workspace (e.g., for ADHD or autism)
- Service animal in the workplace
- Extended breaks (e.g., for medical treatments)
- Modified duties (e.g., reassign non-essential tasks)

---

### What Is "Undue Hardship"?

**Definition:** An accommodation that would cause significant difficulty or expense.

**Examples of potential undue hardship:**
- Structural changes that cost more than 10% of annual revenue
- Accommodation that fundamentally alters the job (e.g., a delivery driver who can't drive)
- Accommodation that creates a safety risk (e.g., allowing someone to operate heavy machinery when they have uncontrolled seizures)

**Note:** The bar for "undue hardship" is HIGH. Most accommodations are low-cost or free.

---

## The Accommodation Request Process

### Step 1: Employee Requests Accommodation

**Triggers:**
- Employee says: "I need [accommodation] because of a medical condition."
- Employee says: "I have a disability and need help with [task]."
- Manager notices employee struggling and asks: "Do you need any support?"

**What the employee does NOT need to disclose:**
- Specific diagnosis ("I have ADHD" vs. "I have a medical condition")
- Medical records upfront

---

### Step 2: Interactive Process

**What it is:** A conversation between the employee, manager, and HR to identify possible accommodations.

**Questions to Ask:**
- "What specific tasks are difficult for you?"
- "What accommodations have worked for you in the past?"
- "What would help you perform your job effectively?"

**HR's Role:**
- Facilitate the conversation
- Suggest possible accommodations
- Determine if accommodation is reasonable
- Document the process

---

### Step 3: Request Medical Documentation (If Needed)

**When to request:**
- If the disability is not obvious (e.g., employee requests accommodation for invisible disability)
- If you need to verify the employee's limitation

**What you can ask for:**
- Medical certification that the employee has a disability (yes/no)
- Functional limitations (e.g., "Employee cannot sit for more than 2 hours at a time")
- Recommended accommodations (if any)

**What you CANNOT ask for:**
- Specific diagnosis
- Full medical records
- Unrelated medical history

**Template Request:**

```
Subject: Medical Documentation for Accommodation Request

Hi [Employee],

Thank you for requesting an accommodation. To help us identify the best solution, we need medical documentation from your healthcare provider.

Please have your provider complete the attached form, which asks:
1. Confirmation that you have a medical condition that qualifies as a disability under the ADA
2. Functional limitations related to your work
3. Recommended accommodations (if any)

Your provider should NOT include your specific diagnosis or detailed medical history.

Please submit this by [Date]. If you need an extension, let me know.

Thanks,
[HR Name]
```

---

### Step 4: Evaluate and Implement Accommodation

**Evaluation:**
- Is the accommodation reasonable? (Does it enable the employee to do the essential functions of the job?)
- Does it cause undue hardship? (Unlikely)
- Are there alternative accommodations that are equally effective?

**Decision:**
- Approve and implement
- Offer alternative accommodation (if original isn't feasible)
- Deny (only if undue hardship; must document reasoning)

**Implementation:**
- Work with employee to set up accommodation
- Train manager on how to support employee
- Document the accommodation in HR records (confidential)

---

### Step 5: Monitor and Adjust

**Check in regularly:**
- "Is the accommodation working for you?"
- "Do you need anything else?"
- "Has your condition changed?"

**Accommodations can change:**
- Employee's needs may evolve
- Job duties may change
- Technology may improve

## Inclusive Language and Practices

### Pronouns and Names

**Why it matters:** Transgender and non-binary employees may change their name and pronouns.

**Best Practices:**
- [ ] Add pronouns to Slack profiles, email signatures, Zoom names
- [ ] Normalize sharing pronouns in introductions: "Hi, I'm Alex, I use they/them pronouns"
- [ ] Update name in HRIS, email, Slack immediately when requested (within 24 hours)
- [ ] Don't ask why someone is changing their name (none of your business)

**If you make a mistake:**
- Apologize briefly: "Sorry, they. As I was saying..."
- Don't make a big deal out of it
- Correct yourself and move on

---

### Disability Language

**Person-First vs. Identity-First:**

**Person-First Language:**
- "Person with a disability" (emphasizes personhood)
- "Person with autism"
- Preferred by some disability communities

**Identity-First Language:**
- "Disabled person" (disability is part of identity)
- "Autistic person"
- Preferred by many autistic and deaf communities

**Best Practice:** Ask the individual their preference. Default to person-first if unsure.

---

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Suffers from" (e.g., "suffers from autism")
- ❌ "Wheelchair-bound" → ✅ "Wheelchair user" (wheelchair enables mobility)
- ❌ "Handicapped" → ✅ "Disabled" or "Person with a disability"
- ❌ "Special needs" → ✅ "Access needs" or "Accommodations"
- ❌ "Crazy," "insane," "bipolar" (as metaphors) → Ableist language

---

### Asking About Accommodations

**How to ask:**
> "Do you need any accommodations to do your best work here?"

**Don't:**
- ❌ "Do you have any disabilities?" (too invasive)
- ❌ "What's wrong with you?" (rude)
- ❌ "Why do you need that?" (none of your business)

**Do:**
- ✅ Ask once during onboarding
- ✅ Remind employees periodically that accommodations are available
- ✅ Make it easy to request (e.g., email hr@company.com or fill out form)

---

## Disability Disclosure

### Should Employees Disclose?

**Employees are NOT required to disclose a disability** unless:
- They need an accommodation
- The disability affects their ability to perform essential job functions

**Pros of Disclosing:**
- Access to accommodations
- Legal protections under ADA
- Reduces stress of hiding disability

**Cons of Disclosing:**
- Stigma and bias (real concern)
- Fear of being seen as "less capable"

**As an employer, create a culture where disclosure feels safe:**
- Train managers on accommodations
- Normalize accommodations ("Everyone needs different things to do their best work")
- Protect confidentiality (don't gossip about employees' disabilities)

---

## Confidentiality

**Disability information is confidential medical information.**

**Who can know:**
- HR (needs to know to process accommodation)
- Manager (needs to know to implement accommodation, but NOT full medical details)
- Employee (obviously)

**Who CANNOT know:**
- Coworkers (unless employee chooses to share)
- Other managers

**Storage:**
- Keep accommodation records in a separate, confidential file (not in general HR file)
- Limit access to HR and relevant manager only

---

## Accessibility Training for Managers

**What managers need to know:**

1. **Recognizing accommodation requests**
   - "I'm having trouble with [task] because of a medical condition" = accommodation request
   - Don't wait for employee to say "I need an ADA accommodation"

2. **Interactive process**
   - Talk to employee: "What would help you?"
   - Involve HR
   - Explore options together

3. **Confidentiality**
   - Don't share employee's disability with coworkers
   - Don't gossip about accommodations

4. **Flexibility**
   - Chronic illness fluctuates (good days and bad days)
   - Mental health conditions can worsen during stress
   - Be flexible with deadlines, PTO, work schedule

5. **Inclusion**
   - Don't exclude employee from projects because of disability
   - Don't assume they can't do something—ask

---

## Legal Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Asking About Disabilities in Interviews

**Illegal:**
- "Do you have any disabilities?"
- "Do you have any health conditions we should know about?"
- "How many sick days did you take at your last job?"

**Legal:**
- "Can you perform the essential functions of this job with or without accommodation?"
- "Do you need any accommodations for this interview?" (e.g., extra time, captions)

---

### ❌ Denying Accommodations Without Considering Alternatives

**Example:**
- Employee requests: "I need to work from home 3 days/week due to chronic illness."
- Company says: "No, we require everyone in the office 5 days/week."
- **Problem:** Didn't explore alternative accommodations (e.g., 2 days/week, flexible hours)

**Solution:** Engage in interactive process, consider alternatives, document why accommodation is/isn't feasible.

---

### ❌ Retaliating Against Employees Who Request Accommodations

**Illegal:**
- Firing, demoting, or reducing hours after accommodation request
- Excluding employee from projects because they requested accommodation
- Creating hostile environment

**Legal:**
- Granting accommodation and treating employee the same as before

---

## Final Thoughts

**Accessibility is not:**
- ❌ A checklist you do once and forget
- ❌ A legal burden
- ❌ Only for "disabled people"

**Accessibility is:**
- ✅ An ongoing practice
- ✅ Good for everyone (curb cuts, captions, flexible work)
- ✅ The right thing to do

**Start small:**
- Add captions to videos
- Offer flexible work
- Train managers on accommodations
- Make it easy to request accommodations

**Then scale:**
- Audit your office for physical accessibility
- Test your tools with screen readers
- Launch a neurodiversity ERG
- Tie accessibility to DEI metrics

**Accessibility is inclusion.**
