# Inclusive Interviewing Guide

Practical strategies to reduce bias and create fair hiring processes.

---

## The Problem

**Unstructured interviews amplify bias:**
- "I just have a good feeling about this person" = Similarity bias
- "They went to my alma mater!" = Affinity bias
- "One weak answer" = Horn effect (one negative overshadows everything)

**Result:** We hire people who look like us, not the best candidates.

---

## The Solution: Structured Interviewing

### What Makes an Interview "Structured"?

1. **Same questions for every candidate** (in same order)
2. **Predefined rubric** for scoring answers
3. **Multiple interviewers** scored independently
4. **Calibration** before interviewing starts

---

## Step 1: Design Interview Questions

### Use Behavioral Questions (STAR Format)

**Behavioral questions:** "Tell me about a time when..."
- Forces candidates to share real examples, not hypotheticals
- Easier to score objectively

**STAR Format:**
- **Situation:** What was the context?
- **Task:** What needed to be done?
- **Action:** What did you do?
- **Result:** What was the outcome?

---

### Sample Behavioral Questions by Skill

**Problem-Solving:**
> "Tell me about a time you faced a complex technical problem. How did you approach it?"

**Collaboration:**
> "Describe a time you had to work with a difficult teammate. How did you handle it?"

**Leadership:**
> "Tell me about a time you had to influence a decision without authority. What did you do?"

**Learning Agility:**
> "Tell me about a time you had to learn a new skill quickly. How did you approach it?"

**Bias-Proofing:**
> "Tell me about a time you changed your mind about something important. What made you change your perspective?"

---

## Step 2: Create a Scoring Rubric

**For each question, define:**
- What a "strong" answer looks like
- What a "moderate" answer looks like
- What a "weak" answer looks like

### Example Rubric: Problem-Solving Question

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **4 - Strong** | Clearly defined problem, tried multiple approaches, measured results, learned from outcome |
| **3 - Good** | Defined problem, tried a solution, got results, some reflection |
| **2 - Moderate** | Vague problem definition, tried one approach, unclear results |
| **1 - Weak** | Couldn't articulate problem or solution, no results mentioned |

## Step 3: Train Interviewers

### Interviewer Training (60-90 minutes)

**Module 1: Understanding Bias (20 min)**
- Types of bias (similarity, affinity, halo, horn)
- How bias shows up in interviews
- Why structured interviews reduce bias

**Module 2: Asking Questions & Probing (20 min)**
- How to ask behavioral questions
- Probing for STAR details: "Tell me more about what you specifically did"
- What to listen for

**Module 3: Scoring Practice (20 min)**
- Review rubric
- Practice scoring sample answers
- Calibrate as a group ("Is this a 3 or a 4?")

**Module 4: Inclusive Practices (15 min)**
- Avoid illegal questions (age, marital status, religion)
- Focus on skills, not credentials
- Diverse interview panels

**Module 5: Q&A (15 min)**

---

## Step 4: Diversify Interview Panels

**Why it matters:**
- Candidates from underrepresented groups feel more comfortable
- Reduces in-group bias

**How to do it:**
- Include at least one person from an underrepresented group on every panel
- Don't always assign the same person (overburdening)
- If you can't, acknowledge it: "We're working on increasing diversity on our team"

---

## Step 5: Run the Interview

### Interview Flow (60 min)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-5 min | **Intro & Icebreaker** |
| 5-40 min | **Behavioral Questions** (3-4 questions, 10 min each) |
| 40-50 min | **Technical/Skills Assessment** (if applicable) |
| 50-55 min | **Candidate Questions** |
| 55-60 min | **Closing & Next Steps** |

---

### Tips for Inclusive Interviewing

**DO:**
- ✅ Make candidates comfortable ("Can I get you water? How was traffic?")
- ✅ Take notes (so you remember details, not just impressions)
- ✅ Ask the same questions in the same order for every candidate
- ✅ Give candidates time to think before answering

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Interrupt or talk over candidates
- ❌ Ask leading questions ("You're great at X, right?")
- ❌ Make assumptions based on resume gaps (could be parental leave, caregiving, etc.)
- ❌ Ask about personal life, family plans, or anything protected by law

---

## Step 6: Score Independently

**After the interview:**
- Each interviewer scores using the rubric
- Don't discuss with other interviewers yet (prevents anchoring bias)
- Submit scores to hiring manager

**Hiring manager compiles scores before debrief meeting**

---

## Step 7: Debrief Meeting

**Format (30-45 minutes):**

1. **Round-robin scoring (10 min)**
   - Each interviewer shares their scores and brief rationale
   - No discussion yet (just data collection)

2. **Calibration (15 min)**
   - "I gave a 4 on problem-solving. Here's why..."
   - "I gave a 2. Here's what I was looking for..."
   - Discuss discrepancies

3. **Decision (10 min)**
   - Hire / No Hire / Maybe (need more data)
   - Based on aggregate scores and discussion
   - Not based on "gut feel"

4. **Action Items (5 min)**
   - Who's sending offer / rejection?
   - Next steps if "Maybe"

---

### Red Flags in Debrief

**Watch out for bias creeping in:**

❌ **"I just didn't feel a connection."** → Similarity bias
- Ask: "What specific answers were weak?"

❌ **"They seemed nervous."** → Personality bias
- Ask: "Did they answer the questions well despite being nervous?"

❌ **"They don't have experience at a top company."** → Prestige bias
- Ask: "Did they demonstrate the skills we need?"

❌ **"I don't think they'd be a culture fit."** → Code for bias
- Ask: "What specific behaviors are misaligned with our culture?"

**Good feedback:**
✅ "They scored 2/4 on problem-solving. They couldn't articulate how they measured success."
✅ "Strong on collaboration—gave 3 examples of cross-functional projects."

---

## Inclusive Interview Questions

### What You Can Ask:
✅ "Are you authorized to work in the U.S.?" (legal)
✅ "Can you travel 25% of the time?" (if job requires travel)
✅ "Are you able to work [specific schedule]?" (if job has fixed hours)
✅ "Tell me about a time you had to adapt to a new culture or environment." (inclusive way to ask about adaptability)

### What You CAN'T Ask:
❌ "Where are you from?" (can be discriminatory)
❌ "Are you married? Do you have kids?" (illegal in many states)
❌ "How old are you?" (age discrimination)
❌ "What's your native language?" (national origin discrimination)
❌ "Do you have any disabilities?" (ADA violation—you can ask about accommodations, not diagnosis)
❌ "What's your current salary?" (illegal in CA, NY, MA, etc.)

---

## Accommodations During Interviews

**Candidates may request:**
- Extra time (neurodivergent candidates, ESL speakers)
- Closed captions (deaf/hard of hearing)
- Alternative format (take-home vs. whiteboard coding)

**How to respond:**
> "Absolutely, we can provide that. Thanks for letting us know."

**Don't:**
- Ask why they need it
- Make them feel like a burden
- Decline reasonable requests

---

## Reducing Bias in Resume Review

**Before interviews even start:**

**Use:**
- **Blind resume review:** Remove names, schools, photos
- **Skills-based screening:** Focus on what they've done, not where they went to school

**Tools:**
- **GapJumpers:** Blind auditions (candidates complete a work sample before resume review)
- **Applied:** Blind resume review platform
- **Greenhouse / Lever:** ATS with blind review features

---

## Interviewer Calibration Exercise

**Before your first interviews, practice scoring:**

**Sample Answer to "Tell me about a time you solved a hard problem":**

> "At my last job, we had a bug that was causing crashes for 10% of users. I spent a week trying to reproduce it but couldn't. Then I realized it only happened on older Android devices. I borrowed a device from a friend, reproduced the bug, and fixed it. The crashes dropped to 0%."

**Score this answer (1-4) using your rubric.**

**Then compare with your team:**
- Did everyone score it the same? If not, why?
- Calibrate on what a "4" vs. "3" looks like

---

## Inclusive Interviewing Checklist

**Before Interviews:**
- [ ] Interview panel is diverse
- [ ] All interviewers trained on structured interviewing
- [ ] Questions and rubric finalized
- [ ] Interviewers calibrated on scoring

**During Interviews:**
- [ ] Same questions asked in same order
- [ ] Notes taken
- [ ] No illegal/biased questions
- [ ] Candidate feels welcomed and comfortable

**After Interviews:**
- [ ] Scores submitted independently
- [ ] Debrief uses data (scores), not "gut feel"
- [ ] Bias-checking questions asked

---

## Tracking Diversity in Your Pipeline

**Measure at each stage:**
- **Applications:** % women, % URM
- **Phone screens:** % moved forward (vs. pass rate overall)
- **Onsites:** % moved forward
- **Offers:** % made
- **Acceptances:** % accepted

**Look for drop-offs:**
- Are diverse candidates advancing at the same rate as others?
- If not, where's the bottleneck? (Screening? Interviews? Offers?)

**Example:**
- 30% of applications are women
- But only 15% of phone screens are women → **Problem at screening stage**
- Fix: Review how resumes are being screened for bias

---

**Remember:** Structured interviewing isn't perfect, but it's significantly better than unstructured interviews at reducing bias and hiring the best candidates.
