## The 7-Step ERG Launch Process

### Step 1: Get Executive Sponsorship

**Why it matters:** ERGs need budget, time, and visibility. Executives provide all three.

**What to do:**
1. Identify potential executive sponsors (VP or C-level)
2. Pitch the business case:
   - "ERGs improve retention by 20-30%"
   - "Candidates ask about ERGs in interviews"
   - "ERGs provide product feedback that improves accessibility"
3. Ask for commitment:
   - Quarterly meetings with ERG leadership
   - Budget allocation
   - Company time for ERG activities (not just after-hours)

**Template Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Proposal to Launch [ERG Name]

Hi [Executive Name],

I'd like to propose launching a [Women in Tech / Black Employee Network / etc.] ERG at [Company].

**Why this matters:**
- Retention: ERG members are 20-30% less likely to leave
- Recruiting: Diverse candidates ask about ERGs during interviews
- Product: ERGs provide feedback on [accessibility, localization, user needs]

**What I'm asking:**
- Executive sponsorship from you (quarterly check-ins, advocate for budget)
- $10K-$25K annual budget for events and programs
- Company support (time for meetings, promotion on internal channels)

I've put together a proposal doc [link] with details. Would you be open to a 30-minute conversation to discuss?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

---

## Common ERG Pitfalls (and How to Avoid Them)

### Pitfall 1: ERG Becomes Unpaid Labor

**Problem:** ERG leaders burn out from doing ERG work on top of full-time job.

**Solution:**
- Give ERG leaders explicit time (e.g., 5 hours/month for ERG work)
- Recognize ERG leadership in performance reviews
- Rotate leadership every 1-2 years
- Pay external speakers/facilitators (don't ask employees to do it for free)

---

### Pitfall 2: ERG Is Tokenized

**Problem:** Company uses ERG for optics ("Look, we have an ERG!") but doesn't act on their feedback.

**Solution:**
- Executive sponsor brings ERG feedback to leadership meetings
- ERGs have clear channel to influence policy (e.g., quarterly meeting with HR/CEO)
- Follow through on commitments (if you say you'll change parental leave, do it)

---

### Pitfall 3: ERG Becomes an Echo Chamber

**Problem:** Only one type of person joins (e.g., Women in Tech is only junior women, no senior leaders).

**Solution:**
- Personally recruit senior leaders to join and mentor
- Allow allies to participate (e.g., men can join Women in Tech as allies)
- Diversify programming (don't just do social events—include career development)

---

### Pitfall 4: Overburdening One Person

**Problem:** The same Black employee is always asked to lead Black ERG, represent company at diversity events, etc.

**Solution:**
- Rotate ERG leadership
- Compensate ERG leaders (bonus, promotion, reduced workload)
- Don't always default to the same person—spread the responsibility

---

## Final Thoughts

**ERGs are not a silver bullet.** They don't replace:
- Fair compensation and pay equity
- Diverse hiring and promotion practices
- Inclusive policies (parental leave, flexible work, etc.)
- Accountable leadership

**But ERGs are powerful** when paired with real DEI commitment:
- They create community and belonging
- They develop future leaders
- They provide feedback to make the company better
- They attract and retain diverse talent

**Start small, iterate, and grow.** You don't need a perfect ERG on day 1. Launch with a founding team, run a few events, gather feedback, and improve.
