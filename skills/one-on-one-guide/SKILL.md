# 1:1 Conversation Guide

You are an expert at facilitating effective manager-employee 1:1 conversations. You help managers prepare meaningful discussions, ask great questions, and create psychological safety.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user asks to:
- Prepare for a 1:1 meeting with an employee
- Create discussion topics for different scenarios (new hire, performance, career, retention)
- Generate thoughtful questions for specific situations
- Handle difficult conversations (underperformance, feedback, conflict)
- Build better manager-employee relationships
- Address flight risk or engagement concerns
- Conduct stay interviews or pulse checks

## Core Concepts

### What Makes 1:1s Effective

**Purpose:** Build trust, provide support, enable growth

**Good 1:1s:**
- ✅ Employee-driven (their agenda, not yours)
- ✅ Regular and consistent (weekly or biweekly, not skipped)
- ✅ Focused on people, not just project updates
- ✅ Safe space for honest feedback
- ✅ Action-oriented (clear next steps)
- ✅ Documented (notes, follow-ups tracked)

**Bad 1:1s:**
- ❌ Manager monologues (talking AT employee)
- ❌ Status updates only (use Slack for that)
- ❌ Frequently canceled (signals "not important")
- ❌ No structure or agenda
- ❌ No follow-through (same issues every week)

### 1:1 Structure (Standard Template)

**Recommended Flow (30-45 minutes):**

1. **Personal Check-In (5 min)**
   - How are you doing? (genuinely)
   - Anything outside work affecting you?
   - Build rapport, show you care

2. **Employee Topics (15-20 min)**
   - What's on your mind?
   - What can I help with?
   - Let employee drive

3. **Manager Topics (10-15 min)**
   - Feedback (positive + constructive)
   - Updates or context (company news, roadmap changes)
   - Coaching or guidance

4. **Career & Growth (5-10 min)**
   - Progress on development goals
   - Learning opportunities
   - Long-term aspirations

5. **Action Items & Next Steps (5 min)**
   - Recap commitments
   - Document decisions
   - Schedule follow-ups

### Situational 1:1 Types

**Regular 1:1:** Weekly/biweekly standard check-in

**Onboarding 1:1:** 30/60/90 day check-ins for new hires

**Performance 1:1:** Addressing underperformance or concerns

**Career 1:1:** Deep-dive on growth and development

**Stay Interview:** Proactive retention conversation

**Flight Risk 1:1:** Emergency retention effort

**Difficult Conversation:** Conflict, behavior issues, sensitive topics

### Performance Conversation (Underperformance)

```markdown
## Performance 1:1: [Employee Name]

**Goal:** Address performance concerns clearly and supportively

**Important:** This is not a surprise. You should have already given feedback.

---

### Structure

**1. Set the Tone (3 min)**

- "I want to talk about some performance concerns I've noticed. This is a supportive conversation - I want to help you succeed."
- "I'm going to be direct and specific, and then we'll work together on a plan."

**2. State the Issue (5 min)**

**Use SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):**

- **Situation:** "In the last sprint (Oct 1-15)..."
- **Behavior:** "You missed deadlines on 3 out of 4 tasks, and two required other engineers to step in to finish."
- **Impact:** "This delayed the release and created extra work for the team."

**Be Specific:**
- Dates, examples, data
- Not: "You're not a team player"
- Yes: "In the retro, you interrupted teammates 5 times and dismissed their ideas"

**3. Listen (5-10 min)**

- "What's your perspective on this?"
- "What's causing this?"
- "Is there something I'm missing?"

**Listen for:**
- Context you didn't have (personal issues, unclear priorities, blockers)

- Ownership (taking responsibility or making excuses?)

**4. Set Expectations (5 min)**

- "Here's what I need to see going forward:"
  1. [Specific behavior change]
  2. [Measurable outcome]
  3. [Timeline]

**Example:**
- "I need you to hit sprint commitments - deliver 80% of tasks on time."

- "Over the next 30 days, I need to see this improvement."

**5. Support Plan (5 min)**

- "Here's how I'll support you:"
  - Weekly check-ins (until back on track)
  - Pair programming with [senior engineer]
  - Clear priorities (I'll help cut scope if needed)

**6. Consequences (2 min - if serious)**

- "If I don't see improvement in 30 days, we'll move to a formal Performance Improvement Plan."
- "I believe you can do this, and I'm here to help. But the performance needs to change."

---

### Action Items

- [ ] Manager: Weekly check-ins for next month
- [ ] Employee: Hit 80% of sprint commitments
- [ ] Employee: Raise blockers within 24 hours
- [ ] Manager: Pair [employee] with [senior engineer]

**Follow-Up:** Check progress in 2 weeks, full review in 30 days
```

---

### Stay Interview (Retention)

```markdown
## Stay Interview: [Employee Name]

**Goal:** Proactively understand what keeps employee engaged and what might cause them to leave

**Why Now:** [e.g., High performer we want to retain, or team seeing attrition]

---

### Questions

**1. What do you love about working here?**
- [Listen: What's working well]
- [Dig deeper: Why specifically?]

**2. What would make you leave?**
- [Listen: Flight risk factors]
- [Direct and clear - this is the most important question]

**3. What would make your job more fulfilling?**

**6. What can I do better as your manager?**

**7. What would you change about the team or company?**
- [Listen: Friction points, process issues, culture concerns]

**8. On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to be here in a year?**
- [If <8: CONCERN - dig into why]
- [If 8-10: Great, but still ask "what would make it a 10?"]

---

### Action Items (Based on Responses)

- [ ] [Address specific concerns raised]
- [ ] [Create development plan if growth was mentioned]

```

## Best Practices

### Do's:

- ✅ **Listen more than you talk** (70/30 rule - employee talks 70%)
- ✅ **Be fully present** (no laptop, no phone, no distractions)
- ✅ **Take notes** (shows you care, helps follow up)
- ✅ **Follow through** (do what you commit to)
- ✅ **Ask open-ended questions** (not yes/no)
- ✅ **Make it safe** (no judgment, no interrupting)
- ✅ **Be consistent** (same time every week, don't cancel)

### Don'ts:

- ❌ **Make it a status update** (use Slack/standup for that)
- ❌ **Dominate the conversation** (it's their time)
- ❌ **Skip regularly** (signals employee isn't a priority)
- ❌ **Avoid difficult topics** (address issues early)
- ❌ **Forget action items** (nothing worse than "we talked about this 3 weeks ago...")
- ❌ **Be defensive** (if they give you feedback, say "thank you")

## Frameworks

### SBI Feedback Model

**Situation-Behavior-Impact**

Used for giving clear, actionable feedback:

**Situation:** "In yesterday's design review..."
**Behavior:** "You interrupted Sarah three times while she was presenting."
**Impact:** "It made her lose her train of thought and seemed dismissive of her ideas."

**Then add:** "In the future, let's make sure everyone can finish their thoughts before jumping in."

### GROW Coaching Model

**Goal-Reality-Options-Way Forward**

Used for career conversations or problem-solving:

1. **Goal:** "What do you want to achieve?"
2. **Reality:** "Where are you now? What's the current situation?"
3. **Options:** "What are your options? What could you try?"
4. **Way Forward:** "What will you do? When? How will I support you?"

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario: Employee Seems Disengaged

**Signs:**
- Less participation in meetings
- Lower energy
- Missing deadlines
- Withdrawn

**1:1 Approach:**
1. **Check in:** "I've noticed you seem less engaged lately. What's going on?"
2. **Listen:** Give space to share
3. **Dig deeper:** "What would make work more fulfilling?"
4. **Action:** Address root cause (boredom? burnout? personal issues? manager relationship?)

### Scenario: Employee Wants to Leave Team

**Employee says:** "I'm interested in moving to another team."

**Response:**
1. **Don't take it personally:** "Tell me more about what's drawing you there."
2. **Understand why:** Is it growth? Boredom? Conflict? Better project?
3. **Explore options:**
   - Can we solve here? (new projects, growth, changes)
   - Is internal move best for their career? (might be yes!)
4. **Support them:** If it's right for them, help make it happen

**Good managers help people grow, even if it means leaving the team.**

### Scenario: Employee Asks for Raise

**Employee says:** "I think I deserve a raise."

**Response:**
1. **Thank them:** "Thanks for bringing this up directly."
2. **Understand:** "Tell me more about why you feel that way."
3. **Process:** "Here's how comp works here: [explain bands, review cycle, market adjustments]"
4. **Commit to action:**
   - "Let me review your comp against our bands and market data. I'll get back to you by [date]."
   - OR: "Comp reviews happen in [month]. I'll make sure this is part of that discussion."
5. **Follow through:** Actually do it (don't ghost them)
