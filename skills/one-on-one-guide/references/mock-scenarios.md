## Scenario 1: Sarah Chen - Flight Risk Retention

**Context:**
- Senior Engineer (IC3), 2 years tenure
- High performer (Exceeds expectations)
- eNPS: 5/10 (Detractor)
- Feedback: Comp concerns, career growth, burnout

**Manager Preparation:**
- **Goal:** Understand what's causing dissatisfaction, create retention plan
- **Risk:** Could leave in next 3-6 months if not addressed
- **Leverage:** Promotion path to IC4, equity refresh, workload adjustment

**1:1 Approach:**

**1. Open Honestly (5 min)**
"Sarah, I want to have an honest conversation. I've sensed you might not be as happy as you were 6 months ago. What's going on?"

[Listen - let her share]

**2. Dig Into Each Concern (15 min)**

**If compensation comes up:**
- "Tell me more about compensation. What's driving that concern?"
- "Have you seen offers elsewhere? What are they offering?" (Be direct)
- "Let me look into where you sit in our bands and what we can do."

**If career growth:**
- "What does growth look like for you? IC4? Something else?"
- "What's blocking you from getting there?"
- "Let's map a path - I think you can get to Staff in 18 months. Would that work?"

**If burnout:**
- "Talk to me about the hours. What's driving the long weeks?"
- "What can I take off your plate?"
- "What would sustainable look like?"

**3. Make Commitments (10 min)**

- **Comp:** "I'm going to review your compensation against market and our bands. I'll get back to you by Friday."
- **Career:** "Let's create an IC4 development plan together. I'll draft it and we'll review it next week."
- **Workload:** "I'm taking [specific project] off your plate. We'll hire someone or reassign it."

**4. Check Retention (5 min)**

- "On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to be here in a year?"
- [If <7:] "What would it take to make it an 8 or 9?"

## Scenario 2: Jordan Lee - IC Exploring Management

**Context:**
- Engineer (IC2), 2.5 years tenure
- Solid performer (Meets)
- Interested in management, unsure

**Manager Preparation:**
- **Goal:** Help Jordan explore management vs IC path
- **Reality Check:** Too early for management (needs more IC experience)
- **Approach:** Give "try before commit" opportunities

**1:1 Approach:**

**1. Understand Interest (5 min)**

"You mentioned interest in management. Tell me more - what's drawing you to that?"

[Listen for:]
- Likes helping people → Good signal
- Wants promotion/more money → Wrong reason
- Bored with coding → May just need new challenges

**2. Reality Check (10 min)**

"Here's what I've learned about management:
- It's not a promotion - it's a career change
- You trade coding for people problems
- Your success is now through others, not your own work
- It's meetings, 1:1s, performance reviews - less maker time

Does that still sound appealing?"

**3. Explore Before Committing (10 min)**

"Here's what I'd suggest:
1. Let's focus on IC2→IC3 first (next 18 months)
2. Meanwhile, try leadership tasks:
   - Mentor an intern this summer
   - Lead a small project
   - Shadow me in some 1:1s and planning

If you still love it after that, we can talk EM path in 1-2 years."

**4. Career Plan (5 min)**

"Let's build two tracks:
- **Primary:** IC2→IC3 (technical growth)
- **Explore:** Leadership opportunities (see if you like it)

In 12 months, we'll reassess. Sound good?"

**Follow-Up:**
- Assign Jordan as mentor for next new hire
- Give Jordan a 2-3 person project to lead (Q2)
- Check in quarterly: still interested in management?

- Bootcamp grad, learning quickly

**Manager Preparation:**
- **Goal:** Ensure onboarding is going well, address any early concerns
- **Watch for:** Overwhelmed, confused, lacking support

**1:1 Approach:**

**1. How's It Going? (10 min)**

"It's been a month! How are you feeling?"

- "What's been going well?"
- "What's been hard or confusing?"

[Listen for: specific blockers, confusion, cultural fit]

**2. Work & Projects (10 min)**

- "How do you feel about the work you're doing?"

**5. Next 30 Days (5 min)**

- "What do you want to accomplish in your next month?"
- "What support do you need from me?"

**Common Issues & Responses:**

**If overwhelmed:**
- "Let's dial back scope. You're here to learn, not ship everything in month 1."
- "I'm going to assign you smaller tasks next sprint."

**If bored/underwhelmed:**
- "Good to know you want more challenge. Let's ramp up gradually."
- "Here's a meatier project for next sprint."

## Scenario 4: Taylor Kim - Wants Lateral Move

**Context:**
- Product Manager (IC3), Growth team
- Wants to switch to Platform PM (more technical)

**Manager Preparation:**
- **Goal:** Support exploration, ensure it's right decision
- **Risk:** Could be grass-is-greener, or could be genuine growth opportunity
- **Approach:** Help them validate interest before committing

**1:1 Approach:**

**1. Understand Why (10 min)**

"Tell me more about the Platform PM interest. What's driving that?"

[Listen for:]
- Bored with current work?
- Running from something (team conflict, stress)?
- Running toward something (technical depth, new challenge)?

**2. Validate Interest (10 min)**

"Before you commit, let's make sure it's what you think:
- Have you talked to the Platform PM? Shadow them for a week?
- Do you understand what platform work actually entails? (Less user-facing, more infra)
- Are you prepared for the learning curve? (May feel like a step back at first)"

**3. Explore Options (10 min)**

"Here are your options:
1. **Stay on Growth, go deeper:** Own entire growth org (activation + retention)
2. **Hybrid:** Take on one platform project, see if you like it (split time)
3. **Full switch:** Apply for Platform PM role if/when available

What sounds most appealing?"

**4. Support Their Decision (5 min)**

"If you decide Platform is right, I'll support you:
- I'll intro you to the Platform PM and manager
- You can shadow for 2 weeks
- If it's a fit, I'll help make the transition happen

But I also want you to know: you're doing great work on Growth. Don't feel pressured to leave if this is where you thrive."

**Follow-Up:**
- Set up intro with Platform PM (next week)
- Taylor shadows Platform team (2 weeks)
- Reconvene in 1 month: decision time

## Scenario 5: Morgan Taylor - Top AE Wants Promotion

**Context:**
- Enterprise AE, 3 years, 140% to quota (top performer)
- Wants Sales Director role

**Manager Preparation:**
- **Goal:** Create path to leadership
- **Reality:** No Director role available now, but Sales Manager might open soon
- **Retention Risk:** If blocked on growth, might leave

**1:1 Approach:**

**1. Acknowledge Performance (3 min)**

"Morgan, you've been crushing it - 140% to quota, closing our biggest deals. Really impressive work."

**2. Understand Aspiration (5 min)**

"You mentioned wanting to move into sales leadership. Tell me more about that."
- "What's drawing you to management?"
- "What does success look like in a Director role for you?"

**3. Reality Check (10 min)**

"Here's the situation:
- We don't have a Director role available right now (team of 15, not ready for Director)
- We might have a Sales Manager role opening in 6-12 months (manage 6-8 AEs)
- That's the path: AE → Manager → Director (as company scales)

Would Sales Manager interest you as a first step?"

**4. Build Leadership Path (10 min)**

"Here's what I'd suggest over the next 6-12 months:
1. Keep crushing your number (you're already doing this)
2. Start building management skills:
   - Mentor 2 new AEs (help them ramp faster)
   - Run our weekly deal review (practice coaching)
   - Lead a hire (sourcing, interview, close)
   - Shadow me in pipeline reviews

When the Manager role opens, you'll be the top candidate."

**5. Retention (5 min)**

"I also want to make sure you're compensated fairly:
- I'm going to look at bumping your base (you're at top of band, may need adjustment)
- Accelerators at 150%+ quota (higher commission rate)
- Equity refresh for top performers

You're valuable to this team. I want to keep you and help you grow."

**Follow-Up:**
- Comp review completed (bump base to $155K)
- Assign mentorship of 2 new AEs
- Quarterly check: still on management track?

## Common Themes Across Scenarios

**Flight Risk:**
- Be direct: "Are you thinking about leaving?"
- Understand why (comp, growth, manager, company, external offer)
- Make concrete commitments (not vague promises)
- Follow through quickly (days, not months)

**Career Growth:**
- Map realistic paths (timeline, skills, opportunities)
- Create actionable plans (not just "we'll see")
- Give stretch projects (don't just talk about growth)
- Check progress regularly

**Exploration:**
- Support trying before committing (shadow, part-time, projects)
- Don't block people (help them find right fit, even if it's elsewhere)
- Validate interest (grass isn't always greener)

**Performance:**
- Be specific (SBI model: Situation-Behavior-Impact)
- Focus on behavior, not character
- Create support plan (not just criticism)
- Follow up quickly (don't let it fester)
