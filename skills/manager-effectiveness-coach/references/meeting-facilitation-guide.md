# Meeting Facilitation Guide

How to run effective team meetings, 1:1s, retrospectives, and all-hands.

---

## The Meeting Effectiveness Framework

**A good meeting has:**
1. **Clear purpose:** Everyone knows why we're here
2. **Right people:** Only those who need to be here
3. **Time-boxed agenda:** We know what we're covering and when
4. **Actionable outcomes:** We leave with decisions and next steps
5. **Documented results:** Notes shared afterward

**If a meeting doesn't have all 5, cancel it or fix it.**

---

## Meeting Type 1: One-on-Ones (1:1s)

**Purpose:** Build relationship, provide coaching, align on priorities, unblock employee

**Frequency:** Weekly or bi-weekly, 30-60 minutes

**Who leads:** The employee (their agenda, their topics)

---

### The Perfect 1:1 Structure

**Timing: 30-minute format**

| Time | Section | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0-5 min | **Check-In** | "How are you? What's on your mind?" |
| 5-20 min | **Employee's Agenda** | Their topics (blockers, projects, career, concerns) |
| 20-25 min | **Manager's Agenda** | Your topics (feedback, priorities, alignment) |
| 25-30 min | **Action Items & Closing** | "What are we both committing to?" |

---

### Opening Questions (Check-In)

**Personal check-in:**
- "How are you doing? How was your weekend?"
- "What's on your mind this week?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how are you feeling about work right now?"

**Work check-in:**
- "What's going well this week?"
- "What's challenging or frustrating?"
- "What's your biggest priority right now?"

---

### Employee's Agenda

**Let them drive the conversation.** Your job is to listen, ask questions, and coach.

**If they say "I don't have anything":**
> "No problem. Let me ask you a few things:
> - How's progress on [Project X]?
> - Any blockers I can help with?
> - How are you feeling about your workload?"

**Pro tip:** Keep a shared doc where both of you can add topics throughout the week.

---

### Manager's Agenda

**This is your time to:**
- Give feedback (both positive and constructive)
- Align on priorities
- Share company/team updates
- Address any concerns you have

**Example topics:**
- "I wanted to give you feedback on [specific situation]..."
- "I noticed [behavior/pattern]. Can we talk about that?"
- "Here's what I need from you this week: [priority]..."
- "Quick update on [company news, team change]..."

---

### Closing: Action Items

**Before you end:**
> "Let's recap what we're both committing to:
> - **You:** [Action items for employee]
> - **Me:** [Action items for you]
>
> Sound good?"

**Document these in your 1:1 doc** so you can track follow-through.

---

### 1:1 Topics to Rotate Through

**Don't make every 1:1 just a status update.** Mix in deeper topics:

**Weekly:**
- Current work, blockers, priorities

**Bi-weekly:**
- Career goals and growth
- Feedback (both directions)

**Monthly:**
- Long-term projects and vision
- Team dynamics and collaboration

**Quarterly:**
- Performance and development review
- Compensation and role expectations

---

### Common 1:1 Mistakes

❌ **Making it a status update**
- If the entire 1:1 is "here's what I worked on this week," you're doing it wrong
- Status updates belong in standup or Slack, not 1:1s

❌ **Canceling or rescheduling frequently**
- Sends the message: "You're not a priority"
- Protect 1:1 time—it's the most important hour of your week

❌ **Talking the entire time**
- This is their meeting, not yours
- If you're talking > 50% of the time, you're doing it wrong

❌ **Not taking notes**
- You'll forget what you talked about
- Action items will fall through the cracks

---

## Meeting Type 2: Team Meetings

**Purpose:** Align on priorities, share updates, build cohesion, make decisions

**Frequency:** Weekly, 30-60 minutes

**Who leads:** You (but rotate facilitation to develop team members)

---

### Team Meeting Agenda Template

**60-minute format:**

| Time | Section | Format |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0-5 min | **Quick Wins** | What shipped this week? Celebrate! |
| 5-15 min | **Priorities & Blockers** | What's each person working on? Any blockers? |
| 15-35 min | **Deep Dive** | One meaty topic (design review, retrospective, brainstorm) |
| 35-45 min | **Announcements & Updates** | Company news, new hires, process changes |
| 45-50 min | **Shoutouts** | Thank teammates who helped you |
| 50-60 min | **Action Items & Closing** | What did we decide? What's next? |

---

### Section 1: Quick Wins (5 min)

**Purpose:** Start on a positive note, celebrate progress

**Format:**
> "Let's start with quick wins. What shipped this week? What are you proud of?"

**Go around the room, 30 seconds each.**

**Pro tip:** If the team is quiet, call on people: "[Name], I know you shipped [feature]. Want to share that?"

---

### Section 2: Priorities & Blockers (10 min)

**Purpose:** Ensure everyone knows what everyone else is working on, surface blockers

**Format:**
> "Quick round-robin: What's your top priority this week? Any blockers?"

**Each person shares in 1-2 minutes.**

**If there's a blocker:**
> "Got it. Let's talk about that after the meeting—I don't want to derail us. [Name], let's sync in 30 min."

---

### Section 3: Deep Dive (20 min)

**Purpose:** Go deep on one important topic that requires team input

**Examples of deep dive topics:**
- Design review for a new feature
- Retrospective on a recent launch
- Brainstorm for a technical problem
- Process improvement discussion

**Format:**
> "Today's deep dive: [Topic]. Here's the context: [background]. Here's what I need from you: [feedback, ideas, decision].
>
> Let's spend 20 minutes on this."

**Facilitate the discussion:**
- Ask open-ended questions
- Make sure everyone speaks (call on quiet people)
- Time-box ruthlessly (don't let it run over)
- End with a decision or next steps

---

### Section 4: Announcements (10 min)

**Purpose:** Share company updates, new hires, process changes

**Format:**
> "A few quick announcements:
> - [New hire joining next week]
> - [Company all-hands moved to Thursday]
> - [New expense policy]
>
> Any questions?"

**Keep this short.** If it requires discussion, save it for a separate meeting.

---

### Section 5: Shoutouts (5 min)

**Purpose:** Build team cohesion, recognize contributions

**Format:**
> "Last thing: shoutouts. Who helped you this week? Who do you want to thank?"

**Go around the room.**

**Example shoutouts:**
> "Shout out to Sarah for jumping in to help me debug that nasty bug. Saved me hours."
> "Thanks to Mike for covering my on-call shift when my kid was sick."

---

### Section 6: Action Items (5-10 min)

**Purpose:** Ensure everyone knows what they're committing to

**Format:**
> "Let's recap action items:
> - [Person A] will [action] by [date]
> - [Person B] will [action] by [date]
> - I will [action] by [date]
>
> Anything I missed?"

**Send these in a Slack/email summary after the meeting.**

---

## Meeting Type 3: Retrospectives

**Purpose:** Reflect on what went well, what didn't, and what to improve

**Frequency:** After major milestones (end of sprint, post-launch, quarterly)

**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

### Retrospective Format: Start, Stop, Continue

**Most popular retro format.**

**Instructions:**
> "We just finished [Project X / Sprint Y]. Let's reflect on what worked and what didn't.
>
> I want you to think about three things:
> 1. **Start:** What should we start doing that we're not doing now?
> 2. **Stop:** What should we stop doing because it's not working?
> 3. **Continue:** What's working well that we should keep doing?
>
> Everyone grab a sticky note (or add to this shared doc) and write down your thoughts. You have 5 minutes."

---

**After 5 minutes:**
> "Okay, let's go around and share. [Person A], what's one thing you wrote down?"

**Go around the room, covering all three categories.**

**Group similar themes:**
> "I'm hearing a lot about [topic]. Let's dig into that."

**Decide on action items:**
> "Based on this discussion, here's what we're going to do:
> 1. [Action item 1] - Owner: [Person]
> 2. [Action item 2] - Owner: [Person]
>
> We'll check in on these at the next retro."

---

### Other Retrospective Formats

**Mad, Sad, Glad:**
- **Mad:** What frustrated you?
- **Sad:** What disappointed you?
- **Glad:** What made you happy?

**Sailboat Retro:**
- **Wind (what helped us):** What propelled us forward?
- **Anchor (what slowed us):** What held us back?
- **Rocks (risks ahead):** What should we watch out for?

**4 Ls:**
- **Liked:** What did we like?
- **Learned:** What did we learn?
- **Lacked:** What was missing?
- **Longed for:** What do we wish we had?

---

## Meeting Type 4: All-Hands (Company/Team)

**Purpose:** Align the entire company/team on strategy, results, and updates

**Frequency:** Weekly (small companies) or Monthly (larger companies)

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes

---

### All-Hands Agenda Template

**60-minute format:**

| Time | Section | Who Presents |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 0-5 min | **Welcome & Context** | CEO/Leader |
| 5-15 min | **Company/Team Metrics** | COO/Manager |
| 15-30 min | **Department Updates** | Department heads (5 min each) |
| 30-45 min | **Deep Dive Topic** | Relevant leader |
| 45-55 min | **Q&A** | Everyone |
| 55-60 min | **Shoutouts & Closing** | CEO/Leader |

---

### Making All-Hands Interactive

**Bad all-hands:**
- Leadership talks AT the team for 60 minutes
- No Q&A or discussion
- Death by PowerPoint

**Good all-hands:**
- Interactive (polls, Q&A, breakout discussions)
- Visual (slides with data, charts, photos—not walls of text)
- Storytelling (customer wins, employee spotlights, behind-the-scenes)

**Ideas:**
- **Live polls:** "Should we prioritize Feature A or Feature B?" (use Slido, Mentimeter)
- **Customer spotlight:** Show a video testimonial or have a customer join live
- **Employee spotlight:** Recognize someone who went above and beyond
- **Q&A:** Use Slido for anonymous questions

---

## Meeting Facilitation Best Practices

### 1. Start and End On Time

**Why it matters:**
- Respects people's time
- Sets the tone that you're organized
- Prevents meeting fatigue

**How to do it:**
- Start at :00, not :05 (even if people are late)
- End 5 minutes early (give people a break before the next meeting)
- Use a timer for each agenda item

---

### 2. Use the "Parking Lot"

**What it is:** A place to capture off-topic discussions without derailing the meeting

**How to use it:**
> "That's a great point, but it's off-topic for this meeting. Let's add it to the parking lot and schedule time to discuss it separately."

**At the end of the meeting:**
> "Here are the parking lot items: [List]. I'll schedule follow-up time for these."

---

### 3. Call on Quiet People

**Some people don't speak up unless asked.**

**How to do it:**
> "[Name], you've been quiet. What do you think about [topic]?"

**Or:**
> "Before we move on, I want to hear from everyone. [Name], what's your take?"

---

### 4. Manage the Loud People

**Some people dominate every conversation.**

**How to handle it:**
> "Thanks, [Name]. You've made a lot of great points. Let's hear from others now. [Quiet Person], what do you think?"

**Or (if they're really dominating):**
> "Hey [Name], I appreciate your input. Can you hold your next thought until we've heard from everyone?"

---

### 5. End with Clear Action Items

**Every meeting should end with:**
- What we decided
- Who's doing what
- By when

**Format:**
> "Here's what we're committing to:
> - [Person A]: [Action] by [Date]
> - [Person B]: [Action] by [Date]
> - Me: [Action] by [Date]
>
> I'll send this in Slack/email after the meeting."

---

## Meeting Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: The Status Update Meeting

**What it is:** Everyone goes around sharing what they worked on this week

**Why it's bad:** This can be an email or Slack update

**Fix:**
> "Instead of verbal status updates, everyone post your update in [Slack channel / shared doc] by [Monday 9 AM]. We'll use meeting time for discussion and decision-making."

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: The Meeting That Should Have Been an Email

**What it is:** You call a meeting just to announce something

**Why it's bad:** Wastes everyone's time

**Fix:**
- Send an email or Slack message
- Only meet if there's a discussion or decision to be made

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: No Agenda

**What it is:** "Let's just hop on a call and figure it out"

**Why it's bad:** Unfocused, wastes time, no clear outcome

**Fix:**
- Always have an agenda (even if it's just 3 bullet points)
- Share it in advance

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 4: Inviting Too Many People

**What it is:** "Let's invite everyone just in case"

**Why it's bad:** The more people, the less productive the meeting

**Fix:**
- Invite only decision-makers and people who need context
- For FYI people, send notes afterward

**Rule of thumb:** If the meeting has > 8 people, it's probably too big for meaningful discussion.

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 5: Back-to-Back Meetings All Day

**What it is:** Your calendar is solid meetings from 9 AM - 5 PM

**Why it's bad:** No time for deep work, bathroom breaks, or mental recovery

**Fix:**
- Block focus time (e.g., no meetings Tuesdays 9 AM - 12 PM)
- End meetings 5 minutes early (give people a break)
- Decline meetings that don't require your presence

---

## Meeting Effectiveness Checklist

**Before every meeting, ask:**
- [ ] Do we really need a meeting, or can this be an email/Slack?
- [ ] Is the purpose clear?
- [ ] Do I have an agenda?
- [ ] Have I invited only the people who need to be there?
- [ ] Is there a time limit for each agenda item?

**During the meeting:**
- [ ] Did I start on time?
- [ ] Am I sticking to the agenda?
- [ ] Is everyone participating (or are a few people dominating)?
- [ ] Are we making decisions or just talking?

**After the meeting:**
- [ ] Did I document action items?
- [ ] Did I share notes/decisions with the team?
- [ ] Did I follow up on commitments?

---

## Meeting Notes Template

**Use this template for every meeting:**

```markdown
# [Meeting Name] - [Date]

**Attendees:** [List]
**Duration:** [Start Time] - [End Time]

## Agenda
1. [Agenda item 1]
2. [Agenda item 2]
3. [Agenda item 3]

## Discussion Notes
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Decision made]

## Action Items
- [ ] [Person A]: [Action] by [Date]
- [ ] [Person B]: [Action] by [Date]

## Parking Lot (Topics for Later)
- [Off-topic item 1]
- [Off-topic item 2]

## Next Meeting
- Date: [Next meeting date]
- Topics: [What we'll cover next time]
```

---

## Final Thoughts on Meetings

**Meetings are expensive.** A 1-hour meeting with 8 people = 8 hours of collective time.

**Before you call a meeting, ask:**
1. Can this be an email or Slack message?
2. Can this be a 15-minute conversation instead of a 60-minute meeting?
3. Can I solve this with fewer people?

**Your goal as a manager:** Minimize unnecessary meetings, maximize the effectiveness of necessary ones.

**Good meetings energize the team. Bad meetings drain the team.**
