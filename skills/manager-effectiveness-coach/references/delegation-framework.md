# Delegation Framework

A comprehensive guide to delegating effectively without micromanaging.

## Why Delegation is Hard (And Why You Must Do It Anyway)

### Common Delegation Fears:

**"It's faster if I just do it myself."**
- True in the short term, false in the long term
- You're trading 2 hours now for 20 hours over the next year

**"They won't do it as well as I would."**
- Probably true at first
- But 80% done by someone else > 100% done by you (because you scale)

**"I don't have time to explain it."**
- If you don't have 30 minutes to explain it, you don't have 3 hours to do it yourself
- Teaching once saves you hundreds of hours later

**"What if they fail?"**
- They might. That's how people learn.
- Failure on small tasks is cheap. Failure when they're unprepared for bigger tasks is expensive.

## The Delegation Formula

**Good Delegation = Clear Goal + Sufficient Authority + Appropriate Support + Accountability**

If any one of these is missing, delegation will fail.

---

## Step 1: Decide What to Delegate

### The Delegation Decision Matrix

|  | **You're the Only One Who Can Do It** | **Someone Else Can Do It** |
|------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **High Value** | **Do It Yourself** (Strategic decisions, leadership) | **Delegate & Teach** (Growth opportunity) |
| **Low Value** | **Eliminate or Simplify** (Why are you doing this?) | **Delegate ASAP** (Free yourself) |

---

### Tasks You Should ALWAYS Delegate:

1. **Repetitive operational tasks** (code reviews, data entry, reporting)
2. **Tasks someone else already knows how to do**
3. **Tasks that develop someone's skills** (even if you're faster)
4. **Tasks that are important but not urgent** (documentation, process improvement)
5. **Tasks that are in someone's growth area** (leadership practice for future manager)

### Tasks You Should NEVER Delegate:

1. **Hiring/firing decisions** (you own people decisions)
2. **Performance reviews and difficult feedback** (don't outsource hard conversations)
3. **Strategic vision and direction** (you set the course)
4. **Sensitive HR/legal issues** (confidential or high-risk matters)
5. **Accountability for team results** (you're responsible even if you delegate execution)

---

## Step 2: Choose the Right Person

### Matching Task to Person:

**For Learning/Growth:**
- Choose someone who **wants** to learn this skill
- Choose someone slightly **below** the skill level required (stretch assignment)
- Provide extra support and check-ins

**For Efficiency:**
- Choose someone who **already** has the skill
- Choose someone with **available bandwidth**
- Let them run with it

**For Team Distribution:**
- Don't always delegate to your "go-to" person (creates burnout and resentment)
- Rotate opportunities across the team
- Be intentional about giving junior team members growth opportunities

---

## Step 3: Use the 4 Levels of Delegation

Not all delegation is the same. Match the level to the person's experience and the task's risk.

### Level 1: Do and Report Back

**What it is:** "Do this specific task exactly as I describe. Tell me when it's done."

**When to use:**
- Employee is new to the task
- High-risk task (can't afford mistakes)
- You need it done a specific way

**Example:**
> "Please update the pricing page on the website to show the new $99/month plan. Here's the exact copy to use [link]. Let me know when it's live, and I'll review it before we announce."

**Pros:** High control, low risk of mistakes
**Cons:** Time-intensive for you, doesn't build autonomy

---

### Level 2: Do and Seek Approval Before Proceeding

**What it is:** "Do the work, show me your solution, get my approval before finalizing."

**When to use:**
- Employee has some experience but you want to review
- Medium-risk task
- You're building trust

**Example:**
> "Please design the new onboarding email sequence. Draft the emails and send them to me for review before you schedule them in the system."

**Pros:** You catch mistakes before they go live, employee gets to think independently
**Cons:** Still requires your review time

---

### Level 3: Do and Inform

**What it is:** "Do the work, make the decision, and tell me what you decided."

**When to use:**
- Employee has proven capability
- Low-to-medium risk task
- You trust their judgment

**Example:**
> "You own the sprint planning process. Run the meeting, decide what goes in the sprint, and send me a summary of what you decided."

**Pros:** Builds autonomy, frees up your time
**Cons:** You find out about decisions after they're made

---

### Level 4: Just Do It

**What it is:** "You own this. Make the call. You don't need to tell me unless you want my input."

**When to use:**
- Employee is expert in this area
- Low-risk or routine task
- You fully trust them

**Example:**
> "You own code reviews for the team. Set the standards, enforce them, and handle it however you see fit. You don't need my approval."

**Pros:** Full autonomy, maximum time savings for you
**Cons:** You may not know what's happening (which is okay if you trust them)

---

## Step 4: Set Clear Expectations

### The Delegation Conversation Template

**1. Context (Why this matters):**
> "I'm delegating [task] to you because [reason: it's a growth opportunity, you have the skills, I need to free up time for X]. This is important because [business impact]."

**2. Goal (What success looks like):**
> "Here's what I need: [specific outcome]. Success looks like [measurable criteria]."

**Example:**
> "I need you to ship the new user dashboard by end of Q2. Success looks like: all 5 features working, < 5 bugs in production, and positive feedback from the beta users."

**3. Authority (What they can decide):**
> "You have authority to [make these decisions]: [design choices, tech stack, sprint scope]. You need to check with me on [budget, hiring, major architecture changes]."

**4. Resources (What support they have):**
> "You'll have [resources]: [2 engineers, $10K budget, access to design team]. If you need more, let me know."

**5. Timeline & Check-Ins:**
> "The deadline is [date]. Let's check in [weekly / at milestones] so I can unblock you if needed. Our first check-in is [day/time]."

**6. Questions:**
> "What questions do you have? Is anything unclear?"

---

## Step 5: Provide the Right Amount of Support

### The Support Spectrum

**Too Little Support:**
- Employee feels abandoned ("I don't know what I'm doing")
- They make preventable mistakes
- They're afraid to ask for help

**Too Much Support (Micromanagement):**
- Employee feels suffocated ("They don't trust me")
- They become dependent on you
- They don't develop ownership

**Right Amount of Support:**
- Employee feels empowered ("I've got this, and I know where to get help")
- They make some mistakes (small ones that are okay)
- They come to you for real blockers, not every decision

---

### Calibrate Support Based on Signals

**Increase support if:**
- They're missing deadlines
- They're stuck and not asking for help
- Quality is slipping
- They seem stressed or overwhelmed

**Decrease support if:**
- They're asking permission for every decision
- They're consistently delivering high-quality work
- They're frustrated by check-ins ("I've got this")
- They're ready for more responsibility

---

## Step 6: Avoid Micromanagement

### Signs You're Micromanaging:

- [ ] You're reviewing every decision, even trivial ones
- [ ] You're redoing their work to make it "perfect"
- [ ] You're asking for updates multiple times per day
- [ ] You're dictating exactly how they should do the work
- [ ] You can't let go even when they're competent
- [ ] Your team is afraid to make decisions without you

### How to Fix It:

**1. Ask yourself: "What's the worst that could happen?"**
- If the answer is "minor mistake that's fixable," let it go
- If the answer is "major disaster," then yes, stay involved

**2. Reframe mistakes as learning**
- Instead of: "Why did you do it that way? That's wrong."
- Try: "Interesting choice. Walk me through your thinking. Here's what I would have considered..."

**3. Give feedback on outcomes, not process**
- Instead of: "You should have done X, Y, Z steps."
- Try: "The outcome was [good/needs improvement]. Next time, consider [alternative approach]."

**4. Set clear boundaries**
- "You own [X]. I only need to be involved if [Y happens]. Otherwise, trust your judgment."

---

## Step 7: Follow Up & Hold Accountable

### The Check-In Formula

**Frequency depends on level of delegation:**
- Level 1 (Do and Report): Check in after each step
- Level 2 (Do and Approve): Check in before they finalize
- Level 3 (Do and Inform): Weekly check-ins
- Level 4 (Just Do It): Monthly or as-needed

**Structure of a Good Check-In:**
1. **Progress:** "Where are you on [project]?"
2. **Blockers:** "What's blocking you?"
3. **Support:** "How can I help?"
4. **Decisions:** "What decisions do you need my input on?"
5. **Concerns:** "Any risks or concerns I should know about?"

---

### Accountability Without Micromanagement

**Good accountability:**
> "You committed to shipping the feature by Friday. It's Monday and it's not done. What happened?"

**Micromanagement:**
> "Why didn't you check in with me on Thursday? I would have told you that you were going to miss the deadline."

**The difference:** Good accountability focuses on the outcome (deadline missed), not the process (how they worked).

---

## Common Delegation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Delegating Only the Boring Stuff

**Problem:** You keep all the interesting work for yourself and only delegate grunt work.

**Impact:** Team feels demotivated, doesn't grow, resents you.

**Fix:** Delegate challenging, growth-oriented work too. Rotate who gets the "cool projects."

---

### Mistake 2: Delegating Responsibility Without Authority

**Problem:** "You're responsible for this project, but you need my approval for every decision."

**Impact:** Employee can't actually own it. They're just executing your plan.

**Fix:** If you delegate responsibility, delegate authority too. "You own this. Make the call."

---

### Mistake 3: Taking Back Delegated Work

**Problem:** You delegate something, they struggle, and you take it back ("I'll just do it myself").

**Impact:** Teaches your team not to try hard things. Reinforces that you'll rescue them.

**Fix:** Coach them through the struggle instead. "What have you tried? What else could you try?"

---

### Mistake 4: Not Giving Credit

**Problem:** Employee does the work, you present it to leadership and take credit.

**Impact:** Employee feels used, stops going the extra mile.

**Fix:** Give credit publicly. "This was all [Employee]'s work. They crushed it."

---

### Mistake 5: Delegating Without Follow-Up

**Problem:** You delegate and then forget about it. No check-ins, no support, no accountability.

**Impact:** Work doesn't get done, or gets done wrong.

**Fix:** Set check-in dates when you delegate. Put them on your calendar.

## Delegation Scripts

### Script 1: Delegating a Stretch Project

> "Hey [Name], I want to give you ownership of [Project X]. This is a big, visible project—it's going to [business impact].
>
> I'm giving this to you because I see you're ready for the next level. You've proven you can [handle smaller projects, lead technically, etc.], and this is a chance to show [leadership, strategic thinking, cross-functional collaboration].
>
> Here's what success looks like: [specific outcomes]. You'll have [resources, authority, support]. We'll check in [weekly/biweekly] so I can unblock you if needed.
>
> This is your project to own. I trust you to make the calls. If you need my input on something big, come to me. Otherwise, run with it.
>
> What questions do you have?"

---

### Script 2: Handing Off Your Old Responsibilities

> "Now that I'm managing the team, I need to hand off [task: code reviews, sprint planning, customer support rotation]. I'd like you to take this on.
>
> Here's why I'm choosing you: [you're senior, you have the skills, it's a leadership opportunity].
>
> Here's what I need you to do: [specific responsibilities]. Here's how I used to do it: [process, tools, tips]. But feel free to improve it—I'm not precious about my process.
>
> Let's do this together for the next [2 weeks], then you'll own it fully. Sound good?"

---

### Script 3: Delegating to Someone Who's Nervous

> "I know this feels like a lot. It felt like a lot to me the first time I did it too.
>
> Here's why I think you can do this: [specific skills/strengths]. I wouldn't give this to you if I didn't believe you could handle it.
>
> Here's my promise: I'm not going to throw you in the deep end and walk away. We'll check in [weekly/daily at first], and if you hit a blocker, I'm here to help. But I also trust you to make decisions and figure things out.
>
> What would make you feel more confident about this?"

## Delegation Checklist

Before delegating, ask yourself:

**Clarity:**
- [ ] Did I explain the goal clearly?
- [ ] Did I explain WHY this matters?
- [ ] Does the person understand what success looks like?

**Authority:**
- [ ] Did I give them authority to make decisions?
- [ ] Did I clarify what they can decide vs. what needs my approval?

**Resources:**
- [ ] Do they have the time, tools, and support they need?
- [ ] Did I offer to help if they get stuck?

**Accountability:**
- [ ] Did we agree on a deadline?
- [ ] Did we set check-in points?
- [ ] Do they know what happens if they miss the deadline?

**Confidence:**
- [ ] Did I express confidence in their ability?
- [ ] Did I frame this as a growth opportunity, not a burden?

## Delegation Levels by Experience

| Employee Experience | Start With | Goal (Over 6-12 Months) |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **New Hire (0-3 months)** | Level 1 (Do and Report) | Level 2 (Do and Approve) |
| **Ramped Employee (3-12 months)** | Level 2 (Do and Approve) | Level 3 (Do and Inform) |
| **Experienced Employee (1-2 years)** | Level 3 (Do and Inform) | Level 4 (Just Do It) |
| **Senior Employee (2+ years)** | Level 4 (Just Do It) | Level 4 (Just Do It) + Mentoring Others |

**Move people up levels as they earn trust, not based on time alone.**

## Final Thoughts: Delegation is a Skill

Delegation doesn't come naturally to most people. You have to practice it.

**Start small:**
- Delegate one task this week
- Use a higher level of delegation than you're comfortable with
- Resist the urge to micromanage
- Reflect: Did it work? What would you do differently?

**The goal:** 80% of your time should be on things only you can do (strategy, coaching, hiring, removing blockers). 20% or less should be execution.

**If you're still doing individual contributor work most of the day, you're not managing—you're just an IC with extra meetings.**
