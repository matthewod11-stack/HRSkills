# Difficult Conversations: Scripts & Templates

20+ scripts for the hardest conversations you'll have as a manager.

---

## How to Use These Scripts

**These are templates, not word-for-word scripts.** Adapt them to:
- Your personality and speaking style
- Your company culture
- The specific situation
- Your relationship with the employee

**Before any difficult conversation:**
1. **Prepare:** Know the facts, have examples ready
2. **Get clear on the goal:** What outcome do you want?
3. **Anticipate reactions:** How might they respond? How will you handle defensiveness/tears/anger?
4. **Choose timing:** Private space, enough time (30-60 min), not Friday afternoon
5. **Involve HR when needed:** Performance issues, terminations, legal concerns

---

## CATEGORY 1: Performance Issues

### Script 1.1: First-Time Performance Feedback (Missed Deadlines)

**Situation:** Employee has missed 2-3 recent deadlines.

**Opening:**
> "Hey [Name], I want to talk about the [Project X] deadline. You committed to shipping it by Friday, but it's still not done as of Monday. This is the third time in the last month that a deadline has slipped. Can you help me understand what's happening?"

**Listen:** Let them explain. Common reasons: scope creep, blockers, underestimation, personal issues.

**Acknowledge + Set Expectation:**
> "I hear you [summarize their reason]. Here's the impact: when you miss deadlines, it blocks [other team members / the customer / the launch]. Even if you realize you won't make a deadline, I need you to tell me early—ideally 2-3 days before, not the day of.
>
> Going forward, here's what I need:
> 1. If you think a deadline is at risk, flag it immediately in Slack
> 2. Break your work into smaller milestones so we can track progress
> 3. Hit the next 3 deadlines on time
>
> Can you commit to that?"

**Closing:**
> "I'm confident you can do this. Let's check in weekly on your progress, and if you're blocked, come to me early. Sound good?"

---

### Script 1.2: Second-Time Performance Feedback (Low-Quality Work)

**Situation:** You gave feedback 4 weeks ago about code quality. It hasn't improved.

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for meeting. I want to follow up on our conversation from [Date] about code quality. We talked about [specific issue: lack of tests, buggy code, incomplete features]. I've reviewed your recent work on [Project Y], and I'm still seeing [same issues]. This is concerning because we discussed this a month ago.
>
> What's getting in the way of improving this?"

**Listen:** Is it skill (they don't know how) or will (they're not prioritizing it)?

**If Skill Issue:**
> "It sounds like you need more support here. Let's pair you with [Senior Engineer] for the next 2 weeks to learn [testing/debugging/architecture]. I also want you to spend 2 hours this week reviewing [resource: testing guide, clean code principles]. Can you commit to that?"

**If Will Issue:**
> "I need to be direct: this is a job requirement. Shipping high-quality code isn't optional. If this doesn't improve in the next 30 days, we'll need to have a more serious conversation about whether this role is the right fit. I don't want to get there, but I need to see concrete improvement. Are we clear?"

**Closing (Written Follow-Up):**
> "I'm going to send you a summary of this conversation via email so we're aligned. I'll check in with you weekly, and we'll do a formal review in 30 days. I'm here to support you, but I also need to see change."

---

### Script 1.3: Placing Someone on a PIP (Performance Improvement Plan)

**Situation:** Performance hasn't improved despite multiple conversations. Time for formal PIP.

**Setup:** Have HR present (if possible), have PIP document ready.

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for being here, [Name]. [HR Name] is joining us for this conversation.
>
> We've had several discussions over the past [X months] about your performance, specifically [issue 1, issue 2, issue 3]. Despite those conversations and the support we've provided, I haven't seen the improvement I need.
>
> Because of that, we're placing you on a formal Performance Improvement Plan, effective today."

**Present the PIP:**
> "Here's the PIP document. It outlines:
> 1. **Performance gaps:** [Specific issues with examples]
> 2. **Expectations:** What success looks like over the next [30/60/90] days
> 3. **Support:** Resources, training, mentorship we're providing
> 4. **Check-ins:** We'll meet weekly to review progress
> 5. **Consequences:** If you don't meet these goals by [Date], your employment may be terminated.
>
> I want to be clear: this is serious, but it's not a foregone conclusion. People have successfully completed PIPs and gone on to thrive here. But it requires real, measurable change."

**Answer Questions:**
> "What questions do you have about the PIP?"

[Answer honestly. Don't sugarcoat.]

**Closing:**
> "I need you to read this document, sign it, and return it to me by [Tomorrow/End of Week]. Let's schedule our first check-in for [Day/Time]. I'm rooting for you to succeed, but this is the last chance to turn this around."

## CATEGORY 2: Compensation Conversations

### Script 2.1: Employee Asks for Raise (You Can Approve It)

**Situation:** Employee has earned a raise, and you have budget to give it.

**Response:**
> "Thanks for bringing this up. I've actually been planning to talk to you about this.
>
> You've done exceptional work this year, particularly on [Project X] and [mentoring junior team members]. You've grown significantly in [skill/scope], and I want to make sure your compensation reflects that.
>
> I'm approving a raise to $[New Salary], which is a [X%] increase, effective [Date]. This brings you to [market rate / top of the range for your level].
>
> I want to keep investing in your growth here. Let's talk about what's next for you—whether that's [promotion path, new projects, leadership opportunities]."

---

### Script 2.2: Employee Asks for Raise (You Can't Approve It - Budget)

**Situation:** Employee deserves a raise, but you don't have budget.

**Opening:**
> "Thank you for being direct about this. I appreciate you raising it. Let me share where things stand."

**Honest Explanation:**
> "Here's the situation: We don't have budget for off-cycle raises right now. Our comp review cycle is in [Month], which is [X months] away. That's when we allocate raises across the company.
>
> I know that's not what you wanted to hear, and I recognize you've been doing great work on [specific contributions]."

**What You Can Do:**
> "Here's what I can offer:
> 1. I'll prioritize you for a strong merit increase in [Month] when the review cycle happens
> 2. I'll advocate for you during calibration to ensure you're compensated fairly
> 3. [If possible: I can offer a one-time spot bonus of $X right now]
> 4. [If applicable: I can expand your scope/responsibilities now, which positions you for a promotion in [timeframe]]
>
> Would any of that help bridge the gap?"

**Closing:**
> "I want to keep you here and grow your career. Let's stay in close touch about this, and I'll revisit it during the comp cycle. If your situation changes (e.g., you get an outside offer), please come talk to me before making any decisions."

---

### Script 2.3: Employee Asks for Raise (Performance Doesn't Justify It)

**Situation:** Employee asks for a raise, but their performance is average or below.

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for bringing this up. Compensation conversations are always important. Let me share my perspective."

**Direct Feedback:**
> "Here's where I'm at: Right now, I can't approve a raise because your performance hasn't been at the level I'd expect for a salary increase.
>
> Specifically, I need to see [improvement in X, consistent delivery on Y, ownership of Z]. Right now, you're [meeting expectations / below expectations], but for a raise, I need to see 'exceeds expectations' performance over a sustained period—usually 6-12 months.
>
> I know this is hard to hear, but I want to be honest with you."

**Path Forward:**
> "Here's what needs to happen for you to earn a raise:
> 1. [Specific goal 1]
> 2. [Specific goal 2]
> 3. [Specific goal 3]
>
> If you achieve these over the next [6 months], we can revisit compensation. I'll support you by [offering mentorship, resources, clearer expectations]. Does that sound fair?"

**Closing:**
> "I want you to succeed and grow your compensation. But it has to be tied to performance. Let's check in monthly on your progress toward these goals."

---

### Script 2.4: Employee Has Outside Offer (Counter-Offer Decision)

**Situation:** Employee tells you they have an offer from another company.

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for being transparent with me. I appreciate you coming to me before making a decision. Tell me about the offer—what are they offering, and what's attractive about it?"

**Listen:** Is it just compensation, or is it scope, growth, culture, location, etc.?

**If You Want to Keep Them:**
> "Okay, here's what I'm thinking. You're a critical part of this team, and I don't want to lose you. Give me 24 hours to put together a counter-offer. I'll work with HR and leadership to see what we can do.
>
> In the meantime, can you tell me: if we match the compensation, does that solve it? Or are there other factors (scope, growth, team dynamics) that I should know about?"

**Present Counter-Offer (Next Day):**
> "Here's what I was able to put together:
> - **Salary:** $[New Salary] (matching or close to outside offer)
> - **Equity:** [X RSUs / options with accelerated vesting]
> - **Role/Scope:** [Promotion to Senior Engineer / expanded scope to lead Platform team]
> - **Growth:** [Clear path to Staff Engineer in 12 months with these milestones]
>
> Beyond comp, here's why I think you should stay: [impact you're having, projects coming up, growth opportunities, culture fit].
>
> I can't make this decision for you, but I hope you'll stay. What are you thinking?"

**If They Leave Anyway:**
> "I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision. Let's make your transition smooth—what do you need from me over the next [2 weeks]?"

## CATEGORY 3: Team Conflict & Interpersonal Issues

### Script 3.1: Two Team Members Aren't Getting Along

**Situation:** Alex and Jordan have tension. It's affecting team morale.

**Step 1: Talk to Each Separately**

**To Alex:**
> "I've noticed some tension between you and Jordan lately, particularly during [specific incident: standups, code reviews]. Can you walk me through what's happening from your side?"

[Listen without judgment. Take notes.]

> "Got it. So from your perspective, the issue is [summarize]. How would you like to see this resolved?"

**To Jordan (Same Process):**
> "I've noticed some tension between you and Alex. What's your take on what's going on?"

[Listen, summarize, ask how they want it resolved.]

---

**Step 2: Facilitate Joint Conversation**

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for both being here. I've talked to each of you separately, and here's what I'm hearing:
>
> **Alex's perspective:** [Summarize neutrally]
> **Jordan's perspective:** [Summarize neutrally]
>
> It sounds like you both want [same goal], but you're approaching it differently. Let's find a way to work together that works for both of you."

**Ground Rules:**
> "Here's how this will work:
> 1. We're going to listen to each other without interrupting
> 2. No blaming or personal attacks—focus on behaviors and impact
> 3. Our goal is to find a solution, not to be right
>
> Alex, start by sharing your perspective directly to Jordan."

**Facilitate:**
- Let Alex speak uninterrupted (2-3 minutes)
- Jordan listens
- Then Jordan responds
- Reflect back: "What I'm hearing is..."
- Find common ground: "You both want X. The disconnect is Y."

**Solution:**
> "Here's what I'm hearing as next steps:
> - [Action item for Alex]
> - [Action item for Jordan]
> - [New process or agreement to prevent recurrence]
>
> Can you both commit to this? Let's check in again in 2 weeks to see how it's going."

### Script 3.2: Employee Complains About Teammate

**Situation:** Sarah comes to you complaining that Mike is "not pulling his weight."

**Opening:**
> "Thanks for bringing this to me. Tell me more—what specifically is happening with Mike?"

**Listen + Probe:**
- "Can you give me examples?"
- "How is this impacting you / the team?"
- "Have you talked to Mike directly about this?"

**If They Haven't Talked to Mike:**
> "I hear your frustration. Before I step in, I want you to talk to Mike directly. Here's why: it's possible he doesn't realize this is bothering you. Give him a chance to fix it.
>
> Here's how I'd approach it: 'Hey Mike, I've noticed [specific behavior]. It's impacting me because [impact]. Could we talk about how to handle this differently?'
>
> Try that conversation first. If it doesn't resolve, come back to me and I'll step in. Does that sound fair?"

**If They've Already Talked to Mike (No Improvement):**
> "Okay, so you talked to Mike and it didn't improve. That's when I need to get involved. Let me talk to Mike and get his perspective. Then I'll figure out next steps. In the meantime, can you continue doing [your work] and try to minimize the friction?"

---

## CATEGORY 4: Behavioral & Attitude Issues

### Script 4.1: Employee is Negative / Toxic

**Situation:** Employee constantly complains, is cynical in meetings, drags down team morale.

**Opening:**
> "I want to talk about something I've noticed lately. In the last few team meetings, I've heard you make comments like [specific examples: 'This is never going to work,' 'Why are we even trying this?']. I've also heard from teammates that you're [summarize: venting frustration, complaining about leadership].
>
> What's going on?"

**Listen:** Are they burnt out? Frustrated with legitimate issues? Just negative by nature?

**Acknowledge + Set Boundary:**
> "I hear you're frustrated with [specific issue]. That's valid. Here's the thing: the way you're expressing it is impacting the team. When you say [quote negative comment] in front of the whole team, it demoralizes people and makes them question the work we're doing.
>
> I need you to do two things:
> 1. If you have concerns, bring them to me directly in our 1:1—don't vent publicly
> 2. In team settings, I need you to be constructive. If you disagree with something, frame it as: 'Here's my concern. Here's what I think we should do instead.'
>
> Can you commit to that?"

**Follow-Up:**
> "If I continue to see [negative behavior] after this conversation, we're going to have a more formal discussion. I need you to course-correct."

**Situation:** Employee is late to work / meetings 2-3 times per week.

**Opening:**
> "I want to talk about attendance. Over the last [2 weeks / month], you've been late to [standup / team meetings / work] [X times]. Most recently, [specific example: you missed the client meeting yesterday without letting anyone know]. What's going on?"

**Listen:** Is there a legitimate reason (childcare, health issue, time zone confusion)?

**If Legitimate Reason:**
> "I appreciate you sharing that. Here's what I need: if you're going to be late or miss a meeting, please let me (and the team) know in advance. A quick Slack message like 'Running 10 min late' is all I need. Can you commit to that?"

**If No Legitimate Reason / Pattern Continues:**
> "Here's the impact: when you're late to standup, we either wait for you (wasting everyone's time) or start without you (and you miss context). When you miss client meetings, it reflects poorly on the team and damages our credibility.
>
> I need you to be on time moving forward. If you're going to be late, give me a heads-up. If this continues, we'll need to address it more formally. Are we clear?"

> - [Specific achievement 1]
> - [Specific achievement 2]
> - [Behavior/skill that aligns with next level]
>
> Here's the process: We do promotions during [review cycle / calibration in Month]. I'm going to put you forward for promotion then. Between now and then, I need you to [continue showing X, deliver on Project Y]. If you do that, I'm confident you'll get promoted.
>
> Let's align on what 'Senior Engineer' looks like so you know exactly what to aim for."

**Feedback:**
> "Here's what you're doing well: [specific strengths]. You're solid at [X skill].
>
> Here's what I need to see for you to be promoted to [next level]:
> 1. [Gap 1: e.g., 'Ownership of full projects end-to-end, not just features']
> 2. [Gap 2: e.g., 'Mentoring junior engineers']
> 3. [Gap 3: e.g., 'Influence beyond your immediate team']
>
> Right now, you're [where they are: 'at Engineer III level, but not quite at Senior yet']. It's not a question of *if* you'll get there, but *when*."

**Action Plan:**
> "Here's what I recommend:
> - Over the next [6 months], I want you to [specific project or goal that demonstrates next-level skills]
> - I'll support you by [pairing you with a mentor, giving you bigger projects, etc.]

> Here's what we're currently committed to: [Project A, Project B, Project C]. We're already at [110% capacity / 2 sprints behind].
>
> If we take this on, one of three things has to happen:

>
> Here's what I can offer instead: [alternative: PTO in a different month, hybrid with 2 days remote, transfer in 6 months when there's an opening].
>
> Would that work for you?"

**If They Push Back:**

## General Tips for Difficult Conversations

### Before the Conversation:
1. **Clarify your goal:** What outcome do you want?
2. **Gather facts:** Have specific examples, dates, impact statements
3. **Anticipate reactions:** How might they respond? Plan for defensiveness, tears, anger
4. **Choose the right time/place:** Private, 30-60 minutes, not end of day Friday
5. **Involve HR if needed:** Performance, termination, legal concerns

### During the Conversation:
1. **Be direct:** Don't bury the lead. Say the hard thing in the first 2 minutes.
2. **Use "I" statements:** "I've noticed..." not "You always..."
3. **Listen actively:** Let them respond. Don't interrupt.
4. **Stay calm:** Don't get defensive or emotional. Pause if needed.
5. **Focus on behavior, not character:** "You missed 3 deadlines" not "You're lazy"

### After the Conversation:
1. **Document it:** Email summary or put notes in employee file
2. **Follow up:** Check in within 1 week to see how they're doing
3. **Be consistent:** If you said there would be consequences, follow through

---

**Remember:** Difficult conversations don't get easier by avoiding them. They get easier by having them.
