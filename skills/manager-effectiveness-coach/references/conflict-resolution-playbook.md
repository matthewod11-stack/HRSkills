# Conflict Resolution Playbook

A practical guide to identifying, mediating, and resolving team conflicts.

## Understanding Conflict

### Conflict Isn't Bad—Unresolved Conflict Is Bad

**Healthy conflict (keep this):**
- Disagreement about the best technical approach
- Debate over priorities or strategy
- Constructive challenge of ideas

**Unhealthy conflict (fix this immediately):**
- Personal attacks or disrespect
- Passive-aggressive behavior
- Gossip and triangulation
- Silent treatment or exclusion

**Your job as a manager:** Encourage healthy conflict, eliminate unhealthy conflict.

---

## The 3 Types of Conflict

### Type 1: Task Conflict

**What it is:** Disagreement about the work itself (what to build, how to build it, priorities)

**Example:**
- "We should use React for this project."
- "No, Vue is better for our use case."

**Is it healthy?** YES—if done respectfully

**How to handle:**
- Let the team debate
- Facilitate a decision if they're stuck ("Let's list pros/cons and make a call")
- Make the final call if needed ("We're going with React. Here's why...")

---

### Type 2: Process Conflict

**What it is:** Disagreement about how the team works (meetings, workflows, tools)

**Example:**
- "We should have daily standups."
- "No, daily standups are a waste of time. Let's do weekly check-ins instead."

**Is it healthy?** YES—process should evolve based on team needs

**How to handle:**
- Get team input
- Try experiments ("Let's do daily standups for 2 weeks, then retrospect")
- Document the decision and revisit periodically

---

### Type 3: Relationship Conflict

**What it is:** Personal tension between people (they just don't like each other)

**Example:**
- Alex interrupts Jordan in every meeting
- Sarah talks about Mike behind his back
- Two teammates refuse to work together

**Is it healthy?** NO—this is toxic and will destroy team morale

**How to handle:**
- Address it immediately (don't let it fester)
- Mediate a conversation between the parties
- Set clear expectations for professional behavior
- Escalate to HR if it involves harassment or discrimination

---

## The Conflict Resolution Process

### Step 1: Identify the Conflict Early

**Warning Signs of Unresolved Conflict:**
- [ ] Team members avoiding each other
- [ ] Passive-aggressive comments in Slack or meetings
- [ ] Dropped collaboration (people stop pairing or asking each other for help)
- [ ] Gossip or venting to others
- [ ] Tension you can feel in the room
- [ ] Decreased productivity or missed deadlines

**Don't wait for it to explode. Address it early.**

---

### Step 2: Talk to Each Person Separately

**Before you bring people together, understand both perspectives.**

**Questions to Ask Person A:**
> "I've noticed some tension between you and [Person B]. Can you walk me through what's happening from your perspective?"

**Listen for:**
- What triggered this?
- How long has it been going on?
- What have they tried to resolve it?
- What do they want to happen?

**Repeat with Person B.**

**Your job:** Gather facts, not to judge who's "right."

---

### Step 3: Determine the Type of Conflict

**Task or Process Conflict?**
- Probably don't need a formal mediation
- Facilitate a decision-making process
- "You both want [same goal]. Let's figure out the best path forward."

**Relationship Conflict?**
- Requires mediation (Step 4)
- Set clear expectations for professional behavior
- May need HR involvement

---

### Step 4: Mediate the Conversation

**Only needed for relationship conflict or escalated task/process conflict.**

**Setup:**
- Private room, 30-60 minutes
- Both people present + you (and HR if sensitive)
- Clear ground rules upfront

---

#### Mediation Script: Opening

> "Thanks for both being here. I've talked to each of you separately, and I know there's been tension. We need to find a way to work together effectively.
>
> **Here's how this is going to work:**
> 1. You'll each share your perspective without interrupting each other
> 2. I'll reflect back what I'm hearing to make sure I understand
> 3. We'll find common ground and agree on next steps
>
> **Ground rules:**
> - Listen without interrupting
> - Focus on behaviors and impact, not character or intent
> - No personal attacks
> - Assume positive intent (even if you disagree)
>
> **Our goal:** Find a way forward, not to determine who's "right."
>
> Ready? [Person A], let's start with you."

---

#### Mediation Script: Person A Shares

> "Tell [Person B] what's been bothering you. Focus on specific behaviors and how they've impacted you."

**Let Person A speak for 2-3 minutes without interruption.**

**Reflect back:**
> "What I'm hearing is: [summarize]. Is that right, [Person A]?"

---

#### Mediation Script: Person B Shares

> "[Person B], now it's your turn. What's your perspective?"

**Let Person B speak for 2-3 minutes.**

**Reflect back:**
> "What I'm hearing is: [summarize]. Is that right, [Person B]?"

---

#### Mediation Script: Find Common Ground

> "Okay, here's what I'm hearing from both of you:
>
> **Common ground:** You both want [same goal: project to succeed, team to work well together, respectful communication].
>
> **Where you differ:** [specific behavior or approach].
>
> Let's talk about how we move forward. [Person A], what do you need from [Person B] going forward?"

**Person A answers.**

> "[Person B], can you commit to that?"

**Person B answers. If yes, great. If no, negotiate.**

> "[Person B], what do you need from [Person A]?"

**Person A answers.**

> "[Person A], can you commit to that?"

---

#### Mediation Script: Agree on Next Steps

> "Here's what I'm hearing as our agreement:
> - [Person A] commits to: [specific behavior change]
> - [Person B] commits to: [specific behavior change]
> - We all commit to: [new process or norm, e.g., 'No interrupting in meetings,' 'Bring concerns directly to each other before escalating']
>
> Let's check in again in [2 weeks] to see how this is going. If it's not working, we'll revisit.
>
> Can you both commit to this?"

**Get verbal agreement from both.**

**Document it:** Send a follow-up email summarizing the agreement.

## Common Conflict Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: Two Strong Opinions, Both Want to Be Right

**Example:** Alex and Jordan both think their technical approach is best. Neither will budge.

**Root Cause:** Ego, lack of psychological safety, unclear decision-making process

**Solution:**

**Option A: Let them debate and make a decision**
> "You've both made good points. Let's list the pros/cons of each approach. Then we're going to make a decision—React or Vue—and commit to it. Sound good?"

**Option B: Make the call yourself**
> "I've heard both perspectives. Here's my decision: We're going with React. Here's why: [rationale]. I know you disagree, Jordan, and I respect that. But we need to move forward, and this is the call. Can you commit to making it work?"

**Follow-Up:**
> "For future decisions like this, let's use [decision-making framework: RFC process, voting, defer to tech lead]. That way we have a clear process instead of endless debate."

---

### Scenario 2: Passive-Aggressive Behavior

**Example:** Sarah disagrees with Mike's proposal but doesn't say so in the meeting. Instead, she makes sarcastic comments in Slack later.

**Root Cause:** Conflict avoidance, lack of trust, fear of confrontation

**Solution:**

**Talk to Sarah privately:**
> "I noticed in yesterday's meeting you didn't speak up when Mike proposed [idea], but then you made some comments in Slack that seemed like you disagreed. What's going on?"

[Listen]

> "Here's the thing: if you disagree with something, I need you to say so in the moment—respectfully, but directly. Venting afterward in Slack undermines Mike and makes it hard for the team to trust each other.
>
> Can we agree that going forward, if you disagree, you'll speak up in the meeting? If you're uncomfortable doing that, come talk to me 1:1, but don't go around Mike."

---

### Scenario 3: Constant Interruptions

**Example:** Every time Jordan speaks in meetings, Alex interrupts or talks over them.

**Root Cause:** Dominance behavior, unconscious bias, lack of awareness

**Solution:**

**In the moment (during the meeting):**
> "Hold on, Alex. Jordan was speaking. Jordan, please continue."

**After the meeting (talk to Alex privately):**
> "Hey Alex, I want to give you some feedback. In today's meeting, you interrupted Jordan three times while they were presenting. I know you probably weren't trying to be disrespectful, but the impact is that Jordan's ideas get shut down and they feel dismissed.
>
> Going forward, I need you to let people finish their thoughts before jumping in. If you have a question or comment, jot it down and wait until they're done. Can you commit to that?"

---

### Scenario 4: Gossip & Triangulation

**Example:** Mike complains to you about Sarah. You later find out he's also complaining to other teammates but hasn't talked to Sarah directly.

**Root Cause:** Conflict avoidance, political behavior, lack of trust

**Solution:**

**Redirect to Direct Communication:**
> "I hear your frustration with Sarah. Have you talked to her directly about this?"

[If no:]

> "Here's what I need you to do: Talk to Sarah first. Say something like, 'Hey Sarah, when you [behavior], it impacts me because [impact]. Can we talk about how to handle this differently?'
>
> If you talk to her and it doesn't get resolved, come back to me and I'll step in. But she deserves to hear this from you first, not from me or other teammates."

**If Mike refuses:**
> "I understand that's uncomfortable, but part of being on this team is addressing conflicts directly. If you're not willing to talk to Sarah, then I'm going to assume this isn't a big enough issue to act on. Which would you prefer?"

---

### Scenario 5: Personality Clash

**Example:** Two people just don't get along. They have different working styles, communication styles, or values.

**Root Cause:** Incompatible personalities, lack of empathy, no common ground

**Solution:**

**Acknowledge the reality:**
> "Look, you two don't have to be best friends. You don't even have to like each other. But you do have to work together professionally.
>
> Here's what I need from both of you:
> - Respect in all interactions (no eye-rolling, no sarcasm, no dismissive comments)
> - Clear, direct communication (no passive-aggression)
> - Collaboration on shared projects (even if you'd rather not)
>
> Can you both commit to that?"

**Set boundaries:**
> "If you can't be in the same room together without tension, we'll minimize your collaboration. But that limits your growth and the team's flexibility. I'd rather you figure out how to work together."

**If it escalates:**
> "If this continues, one or both of you may need to move to a different team or leave the company. I don't want to get there, but I will if this keeps affecting the team."

## Red Flags: When to Escalate to HR

**Escalate immediately if:**
- [ ] Harassment (sexual, racial, or based on protected class)
- [ ] Threats of violence or intimidation
- [ ] Discrimination (biased comments about gender, race, age, etc.)
- [ ] Retaliation (punishment for reporting an issue)
- [ ] Illegal behavior (theft, fraud, data breach)

**Escalate after you've tried to mediate if:**
- [ ] Conflict isn't resolving despite multiple conversations
- [ ] One person refuses to participate in resolution
- [ ] Behavior is creating a hostile work environment
- [ ] You're uncomfortable handling it alone (trust your gut)

**How to escalate:**
> "Based on what you've shared, I think we need to bring in HR. This is [serious enough / beyond my scope / a legal concern]. I'm going to loop in [HR Name] so we handle this properly."

---

## Preventing Conflict Before It Starts

### Build Psychological Safety

**What it is:** Team members feel safe to speak up, disagree, ask questions, and admit mistakes without fear of punishment or embarrassment.

**How to build it:**
- **Model vulnerability:** Admit when you don't know something or made a mistake
- **Reward dissent:** "I'm glad you challenged that. That's exactly the kind of thinking we need."
- **Punish disrespect, not disagreement:** "It's okay to disagree. It's not okay to dismiss someone's idea without listening."

---

### Set Clear Norms

**Example norms:**
- "We disagree openly and respectfully."
- "We don't interrupt each other in meetings."
- "We bring concerns directly to the person, not behind their backs."
- "We assume positive intent."

**Document these and reference them when conflict arises:**
> "Remember, one of our team norms is 'no interruptions.' Let's stick to that."

---

### Facilitate Healthy Debate

**Teach your team how to disagree productively:**

**Bad disagreement:**
> "That's a terrible idea."

**Good disagreement:**
> "I see your point, but here's my concern: [specific issue]. Have you considered [alternative]?"

**Model this yourself:**
> "I respectfully disagree with that approach. Here's why: [data/reasoning]. But I'm open to being convinced. What am I missing?"

---

## Conflict Resolution Checklist

**When conflict arises, ask yourself:**

**Assessment:**
- [ ] What type of conflict is this? (Task, process, relationship?)
- [ ] How serious is it? (Annoying vs. team-destroying?)
- [ ] How long has it been going on?
- [ ] Have they tried to resolve it themselves?

**Action:**
- [ ] Talk to each person separately to understand both perspectives
- [ ] Determine if mediation is needed
- [ ] Facilitate a conversation with clear ground rules
- [ ] Get agreement on next steps
- [ ] Document the agreement

**Follow-Up:**
- [ ] Check in within 1-2 weeks
- [ ] Monitor for repeat behavior
- [ ] Escalate to HR if needed

## Conflict Resolution Scripts

### Script 1: Addressing Gossip

> "Hey [Name], I need to talk to you about something. I've heard from a couple people that you've been venting about [Person/Issue] to other teammates.
>
> Here's the problem: when you do that, it creates drama and undermines trust on the team. If you have an issue with [Person], you need to talk to them directly. If you've tried that and it didn't work, come to me. But don't go around them.
>
> Can we agree on that going forward?"

---

### Script 2: Stopping an Argument in a Meeting

> "Hold on, everyone. This conversation is getting heated, and I don't think we're going to resolve it right now.
>
> Here's what I'm going to do: [Person A] and [Person B], let's schedule time after this meeting to talk through this in detail. For now, let's table it and move on to the next agenda item.
>
> Sound good?"

---

### Script 3: Setting Expectations After Mediation

> "We just had a tough conversation, and I appreciate both of you being willing to work through this.
>
> Here's what I need from both of you going forward: [specific behaviors]. If I see [old pattern] happening again, I'm going to call it out immediately.
>
> I believe you can both do this. But if this doesn't improve over the next [2-4 weeks], we'll need to have a more serious conversation about whether you can continue working together.
>
> Let's check in [weekly/biweekly] to make sure we're on track. Any questions?"

---

## Final Thoughts

**Conflict is inevitable.** You can't prevent it entirely. But you can:
- Catch it early
- Address it directly
- Facilitate resolution
- Set clear expectations

**The worst thing you can do is ignore it.** Unresolved conflict spreads like a virus—it demoralizes the team, tanks productivity, and drives your best people away.

**Your job as a manager: Create an environment where healthy conflict thrives and toxic conflict dies.**
