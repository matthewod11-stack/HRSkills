2. **Involve legal early** - Day 1, not last minute
3. **Communicate clearly** - Honesty and transparency
4. **Support everyone** - Departing and remaining employees
5. **Document everything** - You'll need it if sued
6. **Be humane** - This affects people's lives

Workforce reductions are hard, but they can be executed with dignity, fairness, and care.
