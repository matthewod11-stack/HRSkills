## ⚖️ Legal Warning

**This guide is educational, not legal advice.**

**Always consult employment counsel before executing a RIF.** Laws vary by state, industry, and company size. One mistake can cost millions in settlements.

## Federal Laws Overview

### 1. WARN Act (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification)

**What:** Requires 60-day advance notice for mass layoffs

**Triggers:**
- **50+ employees** at single employment site AND
- One of these scenarios:
  - **Mass layoff:** 50-499 employees (33%+ of workforce) at single site
  - **Plant closing:** Permanent closure of single site, 50+ employees
  - **Mass layoff (large):** 500+ employees regardless of percentage

**Requirements:**
- 60 calendar days advance written notice
- Notice to: Affected employees, state workforce agency, local government
- If less than 60 days: Must pay employees for each day short of 60

**Penalties for non-compliance:**
- Back pay for each day of violation (up to 60 days)
- Benefits continuation for 60 days
- $500/day civil penalty

**Exceptions:**
- Unforeseeable business circumstances
- Natural disaster
- Faltering company (actively seeking capital)

**Example calculation:**
- Company has 200 employees at one office
- Lays off 80 employees (40% of workforce)
- **WARN triggered** (50+ and 33%+)
- Must give 60 days notice OR pay 60 days salary

**Single site definition:** Physical location, not company-wide. Remote workers count toward home office location.

**State variations:**
- **California:** Expands to 50+ employees at site, no 33% requirement
- **New York:** WARN-like protections, 90 days notice for some
- **New Jersey, Illinois, others:** Additional state-level requirements

**Action:** Check state law + federal WARN Act compliance.

### 2. Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)

**What:** Protects workers age 40 and older from discrimination

**How RIFs violate ADEA:**
- **Targeting older workers:** "Let's cut employees over 50 to save costs"
- **Disparate impact:** 60% of RIF is over 40, but only 30% of workforce is
- **Subjective criteria:** "Culture fit" or "potential" often proxies for age

**Red flags:**
- Comments like "we need fresh blood," "young and hungry"
- Offering early retirement only to older workers
- Performance criteria that favor younger employees (e.g., "digital native")

**Older Worker Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA):**
If offering severance to workers 40+, must:
- 21 days to consider agreement (45 days if group termination)
- 7 days to revoke after signing
- Written disclosure of ages and job titles of all in group and not in group
- Advise consulting attorney
- Clear, understandable language

**Example severance clause (required):**
```
You have 21 days to consider this agreement. You may revoke within 7 days
after signing. You are advised to consult an attorney before signing.
```

**Penalties:**
- Back pay, front pay
- Liquidated damages (double damages if willful)
- Attorney's fees
- Reinstatement

**Mitigation:**
- Use objective, role-based selection criteria
- Run demographic analysis before finalizing
- Document business justification
- Avoid age-related comments
- Legal review required

---

### 3. Title VII (Civil Rights Act)

**What:** Prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin

**How RIFs violate Title VII:**
- **Intentional discrimination:** Targeting specific protected group
- **Disparate impact:** Selection criteria that disproportionately affect protected class, even if unintentional

**Disparate impact analysis:**

Compare % of protected class in RIF vs. % in workforce:

| Group | % in Workforce | % in RIF | Difference | Risk Level |
|-------|---------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Women | 40% | 55% | +15% | **HIGH** |
| Men | 60% | 45% | -15% | |
| White | 60% | 50% | -10% | **MEDIUM** |
| Black | 15% | 25% | +10% | **MEDIUM** |
| Hispanic | 20% | 20% | 0% | LOW |
| Asian | 5% | 5% | 0% | LOW |

**Rule of thumb:** If difference > 10%, you have disparate impact risk.

**Defenses:**
- **Business necessity:** Selection criteria are essential to business operations
- **Job-related:** Criteria relate directly to job requirements
- **No less discriminatory alternative:** Can't achieve goal another way

**Example:**
- Company eliminates all junior roles to cut costs
- 80% of junior roles are held by women
- Company must prove: (1) Eliminating junior roles is business necessity, (2) No other way to achieve cost savings

**Mitigation:**
- Run demographic analysis before finalizing
- Adjust selections to match workforce demographics
- Document strong business justification for any disparities
- Use objective, neutral criteria

---

### 4. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

**What:** Prohibits discrimination based on disability, requires reasonable accommodation

**How RIFs violate ADA:**
- Targeting employees with disabilities
- Failing to consider reasonable accommodations
- Assuming disabled employees can't perform in restructured role

**Questions to ask before eliminating role held by disabled employee:**
- Is elimination truly based on role, not disability?
- Have we considered reasonable accommodations?
- Could employee be transferred to another role with accommodation?

**Example violation:**
- Employee with mobility impairment works remotely
- Company eliminates all remote roles to force return to office
- **Potential violation:** May be targeting disability

**Mitigation:**
- Ensure disability doesn't factor into selection
- Consider reasonable accommodations
- Document role-based justification
- Consult legal counsel for any disabled employees affected

---

### 5. Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)

**What:** Protects employees on or returning from FMLA leave

**How RIFs violate FMLA:**
- Targeting employees currently on FMLA leave
- Eliminating role because employee took FMLA recently
- **Retaliation:** Using RIF as pretext to eliminate employee who took leave

**Protected status:**
- Currently on FMLA leave
- Recently returned from FMLA leave (within 12 months)

**Burden of proof:**
If employee on/recent FMLA leave is selected, company must prove:
- Role would have been eliminated regardless of FMLA status
- Selection criteria applied consistently to all employees

**Mitigation:**
- Document role-based justification
- Show others in similar roles (not on FMLA) also eliminated
- Consult legal counsel if any FMLA-protected employee affected

---

### 6. National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)

**What:** Protects employees' right to organize, discuss working conditions

**How RIFs can violate NLRA:**
- Targeting employees who complained about working conditions
- Eliminating "troublemakers" or "complainers"
- Retaliating against union organizers

**Protected activity:**
- Discussing wages with coworkers
- Complaining about working conditions
- Organizing or supporting union

**Example violation:**
- Employee circulates petition about pay equity
- Two months later, employee is included in RIF
- **Potential retaliation claim**

**Mitigation:**
- Document legitimate business reason for role elimination
- Show consistent application of selection criteria
- Avoid targeting employees who engaged in protected activity
- Consult legal counsel if any vocal employees affected

---

## State Law Variations

### California

**Additional protections:**
- **Cal-WARN:** 60 days notice for 50+ at one site (no 33% threshold)
- **CFRA:** State family leave protections (stricter than FMLA)
- **Wage payment:** Final pay due immediately on termination
- **COBRA:** Additional state continuation coverage

**Unique risks:**
- Strong plaintiff-friendly courts
- High damages awards
- Class action friendly

---

### New York

**Additional protections:**
- **NY WARN:** 90 days notice for plant closings (250+ employees)
- **NYCHRL:** NYC Human Rights Law (broader than federal)
- **Wage theft:** Strict penalties for final pay violations

---

### Texas

**At-will employment:** Strong employer protections
- Can terminate without cause (unless contract says otherwise)
- Still subject to federal anti-discrimination laws
- WARN Act still applies if triggers met

---

### Massachusetts

**Additional protections:**
- **WARN:** 60 days notice
- **Severance:** No legal requirement, but case law creates expectations
- **Non-compete:** Strict limits on enforceability post-termination

---

## Documentation Requirements

### What to Document

**For each eliminated role:**
1. **Business justification:** Why this role is being eliminated
2. **Selection criteria:** How you chose this role over others
3. **Alternatives considered:** Could work be consolidated, redistributed?
4. **Performance data:** If using performance, must be documented and objective
5. **Demographic analysis:** Protected class status, disparate impact review
6. **Legal review:** Sign-off from employment counsel

**Master RIF documentation:**
1. Financial analysis (cost/benefit, runway impact)
2. Strategic rationale (business priorities, market conditions)
3. Alternatives considered (hiring freeze, pay cuts, etc.)
4. Selection process and criteria
5. Demographic analysis (overall RIF impact on protected classes)
6. Timeline and communications plan
7. Legal compliance checklist

---

### How Long to Retain

**Federal requirements:**
- EEOC: 1 year from termination (2 years for federal contractors)
- WARN Act: 3 years
- ADEA: 3 years

**Best practice:** Retain all RIF documentation for 5 years.

**What to keep:**
- All selection documents
- Financial models
- Communications (emails, memos, meeting notes)
- Performance reviews (for those affected)
- Demographic analyses
- Legal sign-offs
- Employee acknowledgments

---

## Severance Agreements

### What Must Be Included

**For workers under 40:**
- Clear release of claims language
- Consideration (what employee gets in exchange)
- List of what they're waiving
- Signature and date

**For workers 40+ (OWBPA requirements):**
- All of the above PLUS:
- 21 days to consider (45 days if group termination)
- 7-day revocation period
- Advice to consult attorney
- If group termination: List of ages and job titles of all included/not included

**Example OWBPA-compliant language:**
```
OLDER WORKER NOTICE

This Agreement includes a release of age discrimination claims under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA).

You have 21 days from receipt of this Agreement to consider whether to sign it.
You may use as much of this time as you wish. [If group: 45 days]

After signing, you have 7 days to revoke your acceptance. Send written
revocation to [contact] within 7 days of signing.

You are advised to consult with an attorney before signing this Agreement.

Attached is Exhibit A listing the job titles and ages of all individuals in
the group selected for termination, and all individuals not selected.
```

---

### What Cannot Be Included

**Illegal provisions:**
- Waiver of future rights (e.g., can't file EEOC charge)
- Waiver of rights under WARN Act
- Waiver of workers' compensation claims
- Waiver of unemployment benefits
- Confidentiality about illegal conduct (e.g., discrimination, harassment)
- Non-disparagement of illegal conduct

**Increasingly risky provisions:**
- Broad non-disparagement clauses (NLRB scrutiny)
- Confidentiality about severance terms (NLRB)
- Non-compete agreements (many states restrict)

**Recent trend:** NLRB is challenging overly broad non-disparagement and confidentiality in severance agreements as violating NLRA.

## Common Legal Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "At-Will" Doesn't Mean "No Rules"

**Myth:** "We're at-will, we can fire anyone for any reason"

**Reality:** You can't fire for illegal reason (discrimination, retaliation)

**Even at-will employees have rights:**
- Protected from discrimination (Title VII, ADEA, ADA)
- Protected from retaliation (NLRA, whistleblower)
- Protected under WARN Act if mass layoff

---

### Mistake 2: Waiting to Involve Legal

**Bad:** Plan entire RIF, select employees, draft communications, THEN call legal counsel

**Good:** Call legal counsel on Day 1, involve throughout planning

**Why:** Legal can identify risks early and help structure RIF to minimize exposure

---

### Mistake 3: Poor Documentation

**Bad:** "We picked people based on manager recommendations and gut feel"

**Good:** "We eliminated roles based on strategic priorities. Documented business justification for each role. Ran demographic analysis. Legal approved."

**Why:** If sued, you need documentation to defend decisions. "We had good reasons" without docs = you lose.

---

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Disparate Impact

**Bad:** "We didn't intentionally discriminate, so we're fine"

**Reality:** Unintentional discrimination (disparate impact) is still illegal

**Example:**
- Company uses "years of experience" as criterion
- Disproportionately eliminates younger employees
- **Potential age discrimination (reverse), even if unintentional**

---

### Mistake 5: Retaliation

**Bad:** Employee complains about harassment, two months later is included in RIF

**Risk:** Employee will claim RIF was pretext for retaliation (burden shifts to you to prove otherwise)

**Fix:** Extra scrutiny on any employee who recently engaged in protected activity. Document clear business reason.

---

## If You Get Sued

**Likely claims:**
- Age discrimination (ADEA)
- Sex/race discrimination (Title VII)
- Disability discrimination (ADA)
- Retaliation (various statutes)
- WARN Act violations
- Breach of contract (if employment agreement)

**Damages can include:**
- Back pay (lost wages)
- Front pay (future lost wages)
- Liquidated damages (double damages for willful violation)
- Emotional distress damages
- Punitive damages (if intentional discrimination)
- Attorney's fees

**Cost of defense:** $50K-$500K+ even if you win

**Settlement:** Often $50K-$200K per plaintiff to avoid trial risk

**Prevention is cheaper than defense.**

---

## Legal Counsel Checklist

**When to call employment lawyer:**
- [ ] Before finalizing any RIF plan
- [ ] If 50+ employees at single site (WARN Act)
- [ ] If eliminating any worker over 40
- [ ] If any demographic disparities in selections
- [ ] If any employee recently complained or took leave
- [ ] Before drafting severance agreements
- [ ] If any manager makes discriminatory comment

**What to ask lawyer:**
- Review selection criteria and demographic analysis
- WARN Act compliance check
- State law compliance check
- Severance agreement review
- Communication plan review
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

**Expected cost:** $10K-$50K for legal guidance on RIF, depending on size and complexity

**Worth it?** Yes. One lawsuit costs more.

---

## Final Legal Principles

1. **Get legal involved early** - Day 1, not after you've made decisions
2. **Document everything** - Business rationale, selection process, alternatives
3. **Run demographic analysis** - Before finalizing, check for disparate impact
4. **Use objective criteria** - Role-based, strategic, measurable
5. **Comply with WARN** - 60 days notice or pay-in-lieu if applicable
6. **OWBPA compliance** - For any worker 40+
7. **No retaliation** - Extra scrutiny on protected activity employees
8. **Keep records** - 5 years minimum

**If in doubt, ask legal counsel. Better safe than sued.**
