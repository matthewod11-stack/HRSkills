# Severance Calculation Guide

How to calculate, budget for, and negotiate severance packages.

## Severance Basics

**What is severance?**
Payment and benefits provided to employees when their employment ends involuntarily (layoff, RIF, position elimination).

**Legal requirement:**
**There is NO federal law requiring severance** (except WARN Act pay-in-lieu if applicable).

**However:**
- Many companies offer severance as standard practice
- Some employment contracts or offer letters promise severance
- Public companies may have severance policies disclosed to SEC
- Severance is negotiable

**Why offer severance?**
- Goodwill and reputation
- Smooth transition
- Release of legal claims (employee waives right to sue)
- Employee assistance during job search

## Standard Severance Formulas

### Formula 1: Tenure-Based (Most Common)

**Structure:** X weeks of base pay per year of service

**Common ranges:**
- **Startups/small companies:** 1-2 weeks per year
- **Mid-size companies:** 2-4 weeks per year
- **Large companies/Fortune 500:** 4-8 weeks per year

**Minimum floor:** Usually 2-4 weeks minimum, even for new employees

**Maximum cap:** Usually 12-26 weeks maximum, regardless of tenure

**Example calculation:**
```
Employee: 3 years tenure
Formula: 2 weeks per year
Calculation: 3 years × 2 weeks = 6 weeks severance

Base salary: $120,000/year
Weekly pay: $120,000 ÷ 52 = $2,308
Severance: $2,308 × 6 weeks = $13,846
```

---

### Formula 2: Flat Rate

**Structure:** All employees get same number of weeks

**Example:**
- All employees: 8 weeks severance, regardless of tenure

**Pros:**
- Simple, easy to communicate
- Fair (everyone treated equally)

**Cons:**
- Doesn't reward tenure
- May be too generous for new hires, not enough for long-tenured

**When to use:** Small RIFs, all employees roughly similar tenure

---

### Formula 3: Tiered by Level

**Structure:** Severance varies by role/level

**Example:**
| Level | Severance |
|-------|-----------|
| Executive (VP+) | 6-12 months |
| Senior Manager | 3-6 months |
| Manager | 2-3 months |
| Individual Contributor | 4-12 weeks |

**Pros:**
- Recognizes seniority and impact
- Market-competitive for executives

**Cons:**
- Can feel unfair to ICs
- More complex to administer

**When to use:** Large companies, exec departures

---

### Formula 4: Hybrid (Tenure + Level)

**Structure:** Base weeks per year + level multiplier

**Example:**
```
Base formula: 2 weeks per year
Level multipliers:
- IC: 1x
- Manager: 1.5x
- Senior Manager: 2x
- VP: 3x

Example: Senior Manager with 4 years tenure
Calculation: 4 years × 2 weeks × 2x = 16 weeks
```

**Pros:**
- Balances tenure and seniority
- Flexible and customizable

**Cons:**
- Complex to calculate and explain

---

## What's Included in Severance

### Base Pay

**What's included:**
- Base salary only (not bonuses, commissions, equity)
- Calculated based on annualized salary
- Paid out over severance period OR lump sum

**Example:**
- Base salary: $120,000/year
- Severance: 12 weeks
- Calculation: ($120,000 ÷ 52) × 12 = $27,692

**Continuation vs. Lump Sum:**

**Continuation (salary continuation):**
- Paid as regular paycheck over severance period
- Treated as W-2 wages (taxed normally)
- Benefits may continue during period
- Keeps employee on payroll (administratively easier)

**Lump sum:**
- Paid all at once on termination
- Treated as W-2 wages (taxed normally, may push into higher bracket)
- Benefits usually don't continue
- Clean break

**Most common:** Lump sum payment

---

### Benefits Continuation

**Health insurance (COBRA):**
- Company pays premiums for X months (common: 1-3 months)
- After that, employee can continue COBRA at their own cost
- Cost: Full premium (employee + employer portions)

**Example COBRA costs (employer):**
- Employee-only: $600-$800/month
- Employee + family: $1,500-$2,000/month
- For 3 months: $1,800-$6,000 per employee

**Other benefits:**
- Life insurance: Usually ends on termination date
- 401(k): Vesting usually unaffected, can roll over
- Stock options: See equity section below
- PTO: Must be paid out (in most states)

---

### Accrued PTO Payout

**Legal requirement (varies by state):**
- **Must pay:** California, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota
- **Must pay if policy promises it:** Most states
- **Not required:** Some states (but check company policy)

**Calculation:**
```
Example:
- Employee has 15 days (120 hours) accrued PTO
- Base salary: $120,000/year
- Hourly rate: $120,000 ÷ 2080 hours = $57.69/hour
- PTO payout: $57.69 × 120 hours = $6,923
```

**Include in severance cost estimate**

---

### Outplacement Services

**What:** Career coaching, resume help, job search support

**Typical cost:** $1,500-$5,000 per employee (by level)
- IC: $1,500-$2,500
- Manager: $2,500-$3,500
- Executive: $5,000-$10,000+

**Value to employee:** Often appreciated, helps them land faster

**Include in total severance cost**

---

### Equity Treatment

**Stock options:**
- **Vested options:** Employee keeps, has 90 days to exercise (typically)
- **Unvested options:** Usually forfeited (unless accelerated)

**RSUs (Restricted Stock Units):**
- **Vested RSUs:** Employee keeps
- **Unvested RSUs:** Usually forfeited (unless accelerated)

**Acceleration:**
- Some companies accelerate partial vesting (e.g., next 3 months)
- Expensive but goodwill gesture
- More common for senior employees

**Example cost:**
- Employee has 10,000 unvested options at $1 strike, current FMV $5
- If accelerate 50% (5,000 options): $20,000 cost to company (409A valuation impact)

## Total Severance Cost Calculation

**Per employee calculation:**

```markdown
Employee: John Doe
Title: Senior Engineer (IC3)
Tenure: 3.5 years
Base Salary: $150,000
Location: California

---

**Severance Components:**

1. Base pay severance (2 weeks/year):
   - Formula: 3.5 years × 2 weeks = 7 weeks
   - Calculation: ($150,000 ÷ 52) × 7 = $20,192

2. Benefits continuation (3 months COBRA):
   - Health insurance: $800/month × 3 = $2,400

3. Accrued PTO (80 hours):
   - Hourly rate: $150,000 ÷ 2080 = $72.12/hour
   - PTO payout: $72.12 × 80 = $5,769

4. Outplacement services:
   - Senior IC: $2,500

5. Equity acceleration:
   - None

---

**Total Severance Cost: $30,861**

**Breakdown:**
- Cash (base + PTO): $25,961
- Benefits: $2,400
- Services: $2,500
```

## Budgeting for RIF

### Aggregate Cost Calculation

**Step 1: List all affected employees**

| Employee | Tenure | Salary | Severance Weeks | Base Severance | PTO | COBRA | Outplacement | Total |
|----------|--------|--------|----------------|---------------|-----|-------|--------------|-------|
| John Doe | 3.5y | $150K | 7 | $20,192 | $5,769 | $2,400 | $2,500 | $30,861 |
| Jane Smith | 2y | $120K | 4 | $9,231 | $4,615 | $2,400 | $2,000 | $18,246 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **Total (23 employees)** | | | | **$389K** | **$98K** | **$55K** | **$52K** | **$594K** |

---

### One-Time vs. Recurring Savings

**One-time costs (paid once):**
- Severance pay: $389K
- PTO payout: $98K
- COBRA (3 months): $55K
- Outplacement: $52K
- Legal/HR costs: $25K
- **Total one-time: $619K**

**Monthly savings (recurring):**
- Salaries: $250K/month
- Benefits (health, 401k match): $75K/month (30% of salary)
- Software/tools: $5K/month
- **Total monthly savings: $330K/month**

**Break-even:** $619K ÷ $330K = 1.9 months

**12-month net savings:** ($330K × 12) - $619K = $3.3M

---

### Quick Estimation Formula

**If you don't have exact data:**

**Average cost per employee (rough estimates):**
- **Severance (cash):** 1.5-2 months salary
- **Benefits continuation:** 1.5-2 months
- **PTO payout:** 0.5 months salary
- **Outplacement:** $2,000-$3,000
- **Total: ~4-5 months salary per employee**

**Example:**
- 20 employees
- Average salary: $120K/year = $10K/month
- Estimated total cost: 20 × ($10K × 4.5) = $900K

---

## Severance Negotiation

### When Employees Negotiate

**Common employee asks:**
1. More weeks of pay
2. Extended benefits (6 months COBRA instead of 3)
3. Equity acceleration
4. Extended option exercise window
5. Neutral reference guarantee
6. Outplacement services

**When to negotiate:**
- Senior employees (VP+)
- Long tenure (10+ years)
- Unique circumstances (relocating for job, spouse also laid off)
- Legal risk (potential discrimination claim)

---

### Negotiation Ranges

**General guideline:**
- Standard offer: Baseline (e.g., 2 weeks/year)
- Room to negotiate: +25-50% (e.g., 2.5-3 weeks/year)
- Maximum: 100% increase (e.g., 4 weeks/year)

**Example:**
- Standard: 8 weeks (4 years × 2 weeks/year)
- Negotiated: 12 weeks (+50%)
- Cost difference: $20K → $30K

**When to say yes:**
- Request is reasonable (within 50% of standard)
- Employee is senior or long-tenured
- Avoids legal risk
- Goodwill is valuable (industry reputation)

**When to say no:**
- Request is excessive (3x standard)
- Would create inequity (others find out)
- No legal risk
- Employee hasn't earned it (poor performer, short tenure)

---

### Special Situations

**Executive severance (VP+):**
- Often governed by employment agreement
- Typical: 6-12 months salary + bonus
- May include equity acceleration (single-trigger or double-trigger)
- Change-in-control provisions (M&A)

**Example exec severance clause:**
```
Upon termination without Cause, Executive shall receive:
- 12 months base salary
- Pro-rata target bonus
- 12 months COBRA
- Acceleration of 50% unvested equity
- 12-month option exercise window
```

---

**Sales reps (commission-based):**
- Severance typically based on base salary only, not OTE
- May include commissions earned but not yet paid
- Pipeline deals: Negotiate whether employee gets credit

**Example:**
- Base: $80K, OTE $160K (with commission)
- Severance calculated on $80K base, not $160K OTE
- 8 weeks = ($80K ÷ 52) × 8 = $12,308
- Plus: $15K in earned but unpaid commissions

---

**Founders/early employees:**
- May have founder stock with vesting
- May have promissory notes or deferred comp
- Negotiate equity treatment carefully
- Consider tax implications (83(b) elections, AMT)

---

## Legal Release Language

**In exchange for severance, employee typically signs release:**

**Standard release clauses:**
- Waives right to sue for wrongful termination
- Waives discrimination claims (age, gender, race, etc.)
- Waives wage claims
- Does NOT waive EEOC filing rights (can't legally waive)
- Does NOT waive workers' comp, unemployment

**Example release language:**
```
In consideration for the severance benefits described above, Employee releases
and forever discharges Company from any and all claims, known or unknown,
arising from or related to Employee's employment or termination, including but
not limited to claims under Title VII, ADEA, ADA, state fair employment laws,
and any claims for breach of contract or wrongful termination.

Employee acknowledges this does not prevent filing a charge with the EEOC or
participating in an EEOC investigation, but waives the right to recover
monetary damages in any such proceeding.
```

**OWBPA compliance (age 40+):**
- 21-day review period (45 if group termination)
- 7-day revocation after signing
- Advice to consult attorney
- Exhibit listing ages/titles of all in group

**Without valid release:** Severance is a gift, employee can still sue

---

## Tax Treatment

**For employee:**
- Severance is taxable income (W-2 wages)
- Subject to income tax, Social Security, Medicare
- Withholding depends on lump sum vs. continuation

**For employer:**
- Severance is deductible business expense
- Reduces taxable income

**Example:**
- Employee receives $30K severance
- Effective tax rate: 30%
- Employee nets: ~$21K after tax

---

## Severance Best Practices

### Be Generous (If You Can Afford It)

**Why:**
- Goodwill and reputation matter
- Easier to recruit after layoffs if you treated people well
- Reduces legal risk (employee less likely to sue)
- Helps employee land while job searching

**Benchmark:** Most tech companies offer 8-16 weeks for mid-level employees

---

### Be Consistent

**Why:**
- Inconsistent severance creates legal risk (discrimination claims)
- Employees talk to each other (word gets out)
- Morale damage if "favorites" get better deals

**How:**
- Use formula (e.g., 2 weeks/year) applied consistently
- Document exceptions (exec contracts, unique circumstances)
- Don't negotiate unless necessary

---

### Communicate Clearly

**Include in severance letter:**
- Total amount (cash)
- Payment timing (lump sum vs. continuation)
- Benefits continuation (how long)
- PTO payout (how much)
- Outplacement services (how to access)
- Equity treatment (what happens to options/RSUs)
- What employee must do (sign release, return equipment)
- Timeline (21-day review period if over 40)

**Avoid confusion, reduce back-and-forth**

---

### Document Everything

**Keep records:**
- Severance policy (if formal policy exists)
- Individual severance calculations
- Release agreements (signed)
- Payment records
- Employee acknowledgments

**Why:** If employee sues later, you'll need proof of agreement

## Key Principles

1. **No legal requirement for severance** (unless contracted or WARN pay-in-lieu)
2. **Standard: 1-4 weeks per year of service** (varies by company size)
3. **Include benefits, PTO, outplacement in total cost**
4. **Severance requires signed release** (waives right to sue)
5. **OWBPA compliance for 40+** (21-day review, 7-day revocation)
6. **Be generous if affordable** (goodwill and reputation matter)
7. **Be consistent** (avoid discrimination claims)

Severance is expensive but necessary. It's the right thing to do, and it reduces legal risk.
