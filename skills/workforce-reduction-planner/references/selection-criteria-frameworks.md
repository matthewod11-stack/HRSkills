# Selection Criteria Frameworks

Detailed approaches to selecting roles and employees for workforce reduction.

---

## The Golden Rule

**Eliminate positions, not people.**

This is the most legally defensible approach. You're making business decisions about which roles are needed, not judgments about individual employees.

---

## Framework 1: Strategic Role-Based Selection

**Best for:** Companies with clear strategic priorities, can articulate what must continue vs. what can pause

**Process:**

### Step 1: Define Strategic Priorities

**Question:** What 3-5 things must we do to survive/succeed?

**Example (SaaS company):**
1. Keep existing customers happy (high retention)
2. Close enterprise deals in pipeline
3. Ship core product improvements
4. Maintain infrastructure uptime
5. Raise next funding round

**Not priorities (can pause):**
- New product lines
- International expansion
- Brand marketing
- Process improvement initiatives

---

### Step 2: Map Roles to Priorities

For each role in the company, ask: "Which priority does this directly support?"

| Role | Reports To | Supports Priority | Keep/Cut |
|------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Senior Engineer - Core Product | Eng Manager | Priority 3: Ship improvements | **KEEP** |
| Engineer - New Product Line | Eng Manager | None (paused initiative) | **CUT** |
| Enterprise AE | VP Sales | Priority 2: Close pipeline | **KEEP** |
| SDR (outbound) | VP Sales | New pipeline (not priority) | **CUT** |
| Customer Success Manager | VP CS | Priority 1: Retention | **KEEP** |
| Marketing Coordinator | CMO | Priority none (paused) | **CUT** |

**Result:** Cut roles that don't map to strategic priorities.

---

### Step 3: Capacity Reality Check

**Question:** Can remaining team handle workload?

**If "Core Product Engineers" = 10 people, cutting 2:**
- Remaining capacity: 8 engineers
- Must reduce scope by 20% OR extend timelines
- What features get deprioritized?

**Document this.** Don't just cut people and hope.

---

## Framework 2: Department-Level Targets

**Best for:** Companies that need across-the-board cuts, can't dramatically shift strategy

**Process:**

### Step 1: Set Department Targets

Based on strategic importance and cost structure:

| Department | Current | Target Reduction | Rationale |
|------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|
| Engineering | 50 | 10% (5 people) | Core to product, preserve most |
| Sales | 30 | 20% (6 people) | Focus on closing pipeline, cut prospecting |
| Customer Success | 20 | 15% (3 people) | Critical for retention, light cuts |
| Marketing | 15 | 40% (6 people) | Can defer brand/demand gen |
| Operations | 10 | 30% (3 people) | Consolidate functions |
| **Total** | **125** | **18% (23 people)** | |

---

### Step 2: Within-Department Selection

Each department leader must select which roles to eliminate based on:
- **Role criticality:** Is this role essential to core operations?
- **Strategic alignment:** Does this role support current priorities?
- **Consolidation opportunity:** Can this work be absorbed by others?

**Example: Marketing (cut 6 of 15)**

| Role | Critical? | Supports Priority? | Decision |
|------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Content Writer | Low | No (paused content marketing) | **CUT** |
| Product Marketing Mgr | High | Yes (positioning for sales) | **KEEP** |
| Demand Gen Specialist | Low | No (paused paid acquisition) | **CUT** |
| Designer | Medium | Yes (sales collateral, product) | **KEEP** |
| Events Coordinator | Low | No (paused events) | **CUT** |
| SEO Specialist | Low | No (long-term, not urgent) | **CUT** |

---

### Step 3: Cross-Department Review

HR + Legal review all selections to ensure:
- No patterns of discrimination
- Consistent application of criteria
- Business justification documented

---

## Framework 3: Project/Initiative-Based Selection

**Best for:** Companies that are sunsetting projects, pivoting strategy

**Process:**

### Step 1: Identify Discontinued Initiatives

List all projects/products being shut down or paused:
- International expansion → PAUSED
- Mobile app v2 → CANCELLED
- Enterprise API product → PAUSED
- New vertical (healthcare) → CANCELLED

---

### Step 2: Map Employees to Initiatives

| Employee | Primary Project | Secondary Work | Decision |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| PM - International | International expansion | None | **CUT** (project cancelled) |
| Engineer - Mobile | Mobile app | Core product 20% | **CUT** (mobile cancelled) |
| AE - Healthcare | Healthcare vertical | Some horizontal | **CUT** (vertical cancelled) |
| Designer - Mobile | Mobile app | Core product 50% | **KEEP** (shift to core full-time) |

---

### Step 3: Transition Plan

For those kept, clarify new responsibilities:
- Designer shifts from 50% mobile, 50% core → 100% core product
- Document workload changes
- Set new OKRs aligned to priorities

---

## Framework 4: Layer/Level-Based (Use with Caution)

**Best for:** Companies with too many managers, too much hierarchy

**⚠️ Warning:** High risk of age discrimination (managers tend to be older). Get legal review.

**Process:**

### Step 1: Assess Management Layers

**Example: Engineering Organization**
- CTO (1 person)
- VP Engineering (1 person)
- Engineering Managers (5 people) ← **Too many managers**
- Tech Leads (5 people)
- Engineers (30 people)

**Manager-to-IC ratio:** 5 managers : 30 ICs = 1:6 ratio

**Industry standard:** 1:8 to 1:10 ratio

**Opportunity:** Reduce to 3 Engineering Managers (1:10 ratio)

---

### Step 2: Consolidate Teams

**Before:**
- Team A: 6 engineers, 1 manager
- Team B: 6 engineers, 1 manager
- Team C: 6 engineers, 1 manager
- Team D: 6 engineers, 1 manager
- Team E: 6 engineers, 1 manager

**After (consolidate to 3 teams):**
- Team 1: 10 engineers, 1 manager
- Team 2: 10 engineers, 1 manager
- Team 3: 10 engineers, 1 manager

**Cut:** 2 engineering managers

---

### Step 3: Legal Review

**Age check:** Are eliminated managers disproportionately over 40?

**If yes:** High risk of age discrimination claim. Reconsider approach.

---

## Framework 5: Performance-Based (Highest Legal Risk)

**Best for:** Companies with rigorous, documented performance management

**⚠️ Warning:** Highest legal risk. Only use if you have:
- Written performance reviews from past 12 months
- Objective, measurable criteria
- Consistent application across all employees
- No correlation with age, gender, race

**Process:**

### Step 1: Review Performance Data

**Must be:**
- Recent (within 6-12 months)
- Documented (written reviews, not hearsay)
- Objective (metrics, not "cultural fit")
- Consistent (same standards for everyone)

**Example: Sales Team Performance**

| AE | Q1 Quota | Q2 Quota | Q3 Quota | Avg | Rank | Decision |
|----|----------|----------|----------|-----|------|----------|
| Alex | 120% | 110% | 115% | 115% | 1 | **KEEP** |
| Jordan | 95% | 105% | 100% | 100% | 2 | **KEEP** |
| Casey | 80% | 75% | 85% | 80% | 3 | **CUT** |
| Morgan | 60% | 70% | 65% | 65% | 4 | **CUT** |

**Defensible:** Clear, objective, measurable, documented.

---

### Step 2: Legal Compliance Check

Run demographic analysis:

**Red flag example:**
- 3 of 4 cut are over age 50
- Only 25% of sales team is over 50
- **This is disparate impact on protected class**

**Fix:** Adjust selection OR document strong business justification.

---

### Step 3: Document, Document, Document

For each performance-based cut, keep file with:
- Past 12 months performance reviews
- Specific metrics showing underperformance
- Performance improvement plans (if any)
- Manager notes and documentation

**You'll need this if sued.**

---

## Framework 6: Last In, First Out (LIFO)

**Best for:** Situations where you have no performance data or strategic criteria

**Pros:**
- Simple
- Neutral (not based on performance, age, etc.)
- Seniority-based (rewards tenure)

**Cons:**
- May eliminate promising new talent
- Keeps poor performers with tenure
- May still have disparate impact (newer employees may skew younger)

**Process:**

Rank employees by hire date, eliminate most recent:

| Employee | Hire Date | Tenure | Decision |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Sam | 2020-01-15 | 4 years | **KEEP** |
| Taylor | 2021-06-01 | 3 years | **KEEP** |
| Jordan | 2022-03-10 | 2 years | **KEEP** |
| Casey | 2023-08-20 | 1 year | **CUT** |
| Alex | 2024-01-05 | 6 months | **CUT** |

**Legal note:** Still run demographic analysis. If newest employees are disproportionately one gender/race/age, you may have disparate impact.

---

## Hybrid Approach (Most Common)

**Reality:** Most companies use a combination of frameworks.

**Example process:**

1. **Strategic role-based** (primary) - Identify roles not aligned to priorities
2. **Performance-based** (tiebreaker) - Within remaining roles, if must cut further, use documented performance
3. **Legal compliance check** - Ensure no disparate impact

**Example: Engineering Department (cut 5 of 50)**

**Step 1: Strategic (eliminate project-based roles)**
- Cut: 2 engineers on cancelled mobile app project
- Cut: 1 engineer on paused international project
- Remaining needed cuts: 2 more

**Step 2: Performance (tiebreaker for remaining 2)**
- Review performance data for 47 remaining engineers
- Identify bottom 5% performers with documented issues
- Cut: 2 lowest performers (with documentation)

**Step 3: Legal check**
- Demographic analysis: No disparate impact
- Documentation: Business justification for all 5

**Result:** 5 cuts, defensible approach, legal compliance.

## Red Flags: Bad Selection Criteria

**❌ Never use these:**

1. **"Cultural fit"**
   - Too subjective
   - Often code for discrimination
   - Impossible to defend legally

2. **"Manager's gut feeling"**
   - Inconsistent application
   - Opens door to bias
   - Not documented

3. **"High maintenance" or "Complainer"**
   - May be whistleblower retaliation (illegal)
   - Subjective
   - Not business-related

4. **Salary (cut highest paid)**
   - High correlation with age (discrimination risk)
   - Penalizes experience and tenure
   - Unless you're eliminating senior role for business reason

5. **"Future potential"**
   - Subjective
   - Often age proxy (favors younger)
   - Not current business need

6. **Diversity-based**
   - Illegal (Title VII)
   - Even if intent is to preserve diversity, can't be primary factor

### Business Justification

**Reason for elimination:**
[Example: This role supported our mobile app project, which we cancelled due to
lack of product-market fit and need to focus resources on core web product.]

**Strategic context:**

a strategic priority for next 12-18 months.]

**Alternatives considered:**
- [x] Reassign to core product team - Not feasible (mobile skillset doesn't transfer)
- [x] Consolidate with another role - No similar roles to consolidate
- [x] Reduce to part-time - Not viable for business need

**Decision:** Eliminate role.

## Final Principle

**If you can't clearly articulate why a role is being eliminated in terms of business need, don't eliminate it.**

Vague reasoning = legal risk + morale damage + poor business outcomes.

Workforce reductions should be strategic, not arbitrary.
