# Job Description Best Practices

Research-backed principles for writing effective job descriptions.

---

## The Data

**Poor job descriptions impact:**
- 50% fewer qualified applications (vague or overly specific)
- 30-40% reduction in female applicants (gendered language)
- Higher time-to-fill (wrong candidates apply)
- Increased cost-per-hire (more screening needed)

**Great job descriptions lead to:**
- 40% more qualified applicants (LinkedIn data)
- More diverse applicant pools (inclusive language)
- Faster hiring cycles (better self-selection)
- Higher quality-of-hire (clarity attracts right people)

**ROI is clear:** Well-written JDs attract better candidates faster and cheaper.

---

## The Golden Rules

### Rule 1: Be Specific, Not Generic

❌ **Bad (Generic):**
"Work with cross-functional teams to deliver great products"

✅ **Good (Specific):**
"Partner with Design to spec features, Engineering to ship them, and Customer Success to track adoption"

**Why:** Specific language helps candidates visualize the actual work.

---

### Rule 2: Keep Requirements SHORT

❌ **Bad (Too Long):**
15 bullet points of required qualifications

✅ **Good (Focused):**
3-4 must-haves, 2-3 nice-to-haves

**Why:** Women apply when they meet 100% of qualifications, men apply at 60%. Long lists discourage diverse applicants.

**Research:** Jobs with 10+ requirements get 30% fewer applications (LinkedIn).

---

### Rule 3: Focus on Impact, Not Just Tasks

❌ **Bad (Task-focused):**
"Write code, fix bugs, attend meetings"

✅ **Good (Impact-focused):**
"Build features used by 100K+ users daily"

**Why:** Impact attracts passionate people. Tasks attract clock-punchers.

---

### Rule 4: Be Transparent About Compensation

❌ **Bad (Vague):**
"Competitive salary"

✅ **Good (Transparent):**
"$150K - $200K base + 0.1-0.3% equity"

**Why:**
- Saves time for candidates and company
- Reduces pay gaps
- Many states now require it (CO, CA, NY, WA)
- Builds trust

**Research:** JDs with salary ranges get 30% more applications (Hired.com).

---

### Rule 5: Use Inclusive Language

❌ **Bad (Coded):**
"Rockstar engineer who can dominate our market"

✅ **Good (Inclusive):**
"Skilled engineer who can help us excel in our market"

**Why:** Gendered/aggressive language reduces applications from women and underrepresented groups by 30-40%.

See `inclusive-language-guide.md` for full details.

## Structure of a Great JD

### 1. Opening (Who, What, Where)

**Include:**
- Role title and level (Senior Engineer IC3, not just "Engineer")
- Location (Remote/Hybrid/Onsite + specifics)
- Department
- Salary range
- Equity range

**Example:**
```markdown
# Senior Software Engineer (IC3) at Acme

**Location:** Remote (US time zones)
**Department:** Engineering - Platform Team
**Salary:** $150K - $200K
**Equity:** 0.1% - 0.3%
```

---

### 2. About the Role (2-3 paragraphs)

**Answer these questions:**
- What will they do day-to-day?
- Why does this role matter? (Impact)
- Who will they work with? (Team structure)
- What will they own?

**Keep it short:** 3-4 sentences max.

**Example:**
```markdown
We're looking for a senior engineer to build our data platform. You'll own
features from design to deployment, work closely with Product and Design, and
mentor junior engineers. This role directly impacts how 10,000+ companies make
data-driven decisions.
```

---

### 3. What You'll Do (4-6 bullets)

**Use action verbs:**
- Build, Design, Own, Ship, Lead, Drive, Create

**Be specific:**
- ❌ "Build features"
- ✅ "Build real-time data processing pipeline handling 10M events/day"

**Include:**
- Core responsibilities (60-70% of time)
- Collaboration (who they work with)
- Growth opportunities (mentoring, leadership)

**Example:**
```markdown
## What You'll Do

- Build and scale our data ingestion pipeline (10M+ events/day)
- Design new analytics features with Product and Design
- Write clean, well-tested code your team can maintain
- Participate in code reviews and architecture discussions
- Mentor IC1-IC2 engineers
```

---

### 4. What We're Looking For

**Split into Required and Nice to Have:**

**Required (3-4 bullets max):**
- Must-have skills/experience
- Non-negotiable qualifications
- Focus on skills that can't be trained quickly

**Nice to Have (2-3 bullets):**
- Bonus skills
- Ideal but not required
- Can be learned on the job

**Example:**
```markdown
## What We're Looking For

### Required
- 5+ years building production web applications
- Strong CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms)
- Experience with React, Node.js, or similar modern stack
- Track record of shipping features users love

### Nice to Have
- Experience scaling systems to millions of users
- Open source contributions
- Previous startup experience
```

---

### 5. Compensation & Benefits

**Be transparent:**
- Base salary range (narrow, realistic)
- Equity range (% and vesting)
- Bonus/commission structure (if applicable)
- Key benefits

**Example:**
```markdown
## Compensation & Benefits

**Base:** $150K - $200K
**Equity:** 0.1% - 0.3% (4-year vest, 1-year cliff)
**Benefits:**
- Health, dental, vision (100% employee coverage)
- 401(k) with 4% match
- Unlimited PTO (team averages 4 weeks/year)
- $2K/year learning budget
```

---

### 6. About [Company] (2-3 sentences)

**Include:**
- What you build
- Mission/vision (if compelling)
- Stage and traction
- Why it's exciting to work here

**Keep it brief.** Candidates can learn more on your site.

**Example:**
```markdown
## About Acme

We're helping companies make sense of their data. Backed by Sequoia, 50-person
team, growing 300% YoY. We value shipping fast, clear communication, and
work-life balance (we actually mean it).
```

---

### 7. How to Apply

**Clear instructions:**
- Where to apply (link or email)
- What to include (resume, portfolio, etc.)
- Timeline (when they'll hear back)

**Example:**
```markdown
## How to Apply

Apply at acme.com/careers with:
- Resume
- GitHub profile or code samples
- Brief note about what interests you

We review applications within 5 business days.
```

---

### 8. EEO Statement (Required)

**Always include:**
```markdown
Acme is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed
to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
```

---

## Length Guidelines

**Optimal length:** 500-700 words

**Too short (<300 words):**
- Not enough context
- Candidates can't self-select

**Too long (>1000 words):**
- Discourages applications
- Overwhelming
- Signals bureaucracy

**Sweet spot:** 2-3 minute read time

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Laundry List of Requirements

❌ **Bad:**
```
Required:
- 10+ years experience
- Expert in React, Angular, Vue, Svelte
- Deep knowledge of AWS, GCP, Azure
- Python, Go, Rust, Java proficiency
- Strong communication skills
- Bachelor's in CS from top university
- Previous FAANG experience
- Startup experience
- Open source contributions
- [... 15 more bullets]
```

✅ **Good:**
```
Required:
- 5+ years building production web applications
- Strong fundamentals in JavaScript and modern frameworks
- Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure)

Nice to Have:
- Previous startup experience
- Open source contributions
```

**Why:** Long lists are intimidating and reduce applications, especially from underrepresented groups.

---

### Mistake 2: Vague Responsibilities

❌ **Bad:**
- Work with stakeholders
- Collaborate cross-functionally
- Drive results
- Think strategically

✅ **Good:**
- Partner with Design to spec features, Engineering to ship them
- Present quarterly roadmap to executive team
- Ship features that increase user engagement by 20%
- Analyze user data to prioritize high-impact projects

**Why:** Specificity helps candidates visualize the role.

---

### Mistake 3: Over-Credentialing

❌ **Bad:**
- MBA required
- 10+ years required
- Must have worked at FAANG
- CS degree from top university

✅ **Good:**
- MBA or equivalent strategic thinking experience
- 7+ years or demonstrable expertise
- Experience at high-growth tech companies
- Strong CS fundamentals (degree or practical experience)

**Why:** Over-credentialing disproportionately excludes women, people of color, and non-traditional backgrounds.

---

### Mistake 4: Culture Fit Language

❌ **Bad:**
- Must be a culture fit
- Work hard, play hard
- Like a family
- Must love ping-pong

✅ **Good:**
- Culture add (what unique perspective will you bring?)
- Collaborative and focused
- Supportive team environment
- We value diverse backgrounds and perspectives

**Why:** "Culture fit" perpetuates homogeneity and bias.

---

### Mistake 5: No Salary Range

❌ **Bad:**
- Competitive salary
- Commensurate with experience
- DOE (depends on experience)

✅ **Good:**
- $150K - $200K base salary
- Transparent about equity and benefits

**Why:** Transparency attracts more and better candidates. Also, many states require it.

---

## Level-Appropriate Requirements

### IC1 (Junior)
- 0-2 years experience
- Focus: Learning, growth, mentorship
- Requirements: Potential > proven track record

### IC2 (Mid-Level)
- 2-4 years experience
- Focus: Autonomy, ownership
- Requirements: Proven ability to ship

### IC3 (Senior)
- 5-7+ years experience
- Focus: Leadership, mentorship
- Requirements: Track record of impact

### IC4+ (Staff, Principal)
- 8+ years experience
- Focus: Technical leadership, company-wide impact
- Requirements: Proven technical excellence and influence

**Adjust accordingly:** Don't require 10 years for IC3 or "recent grad" for IC1.

---

## Remote, Hybrid, Onsite Clarity

Be **extremely clear** about location expectations:

### Fully Remote
✅ "Fully remote (US time zones, Pacific preferred)"
✅ "Remote-first company, work from anywhere"

### Hybrid
✅ "Hybrid: 3 days/week in SF office (Tue/Wed/Thu)"
✅ "Flexible hybrid: 2 days/month in NYC office required"

### Onsite
✅ "Onsite in Austin, TX office (5 days/week)"
✅ "Relocation assistance provided"

❌ **Avoid vague:**
- "Remote-friendly" (what does this mean?)
- "Flexible" (how flexible?)

---

## SEO and Discoverability

**Title optimization:**
- Include level: "Senior Software Engineer" not just "Engineer"
- Include specialty: "Senior Backend Engineer" if specific

**Keywords to include:**
- Technologies (React, Python, Salesforce)
- Job family (Engineering, Product, Sales)
- Location (for local searches)

**Don't keyword stuff:** Write for humans first, SEO second.

- 2-3 nice-to-haves

### 4. Inclusion Check
- No gendered pronouns (he/she)
- No age proxies (digital native, recent grad)
- No aggressive language (dominate, crush)
- EEO statement included

### 5. Transparency Check
- Salary range included
- Clear remote/hybrid/onsite
- Level specified

---

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Gather Info
Talk to hiring manager:
- What will they do day-to-day?
- What skills are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
- What's the impact of this role?
- Who will they work with?
- What level is this? (IC2, IC3, etc.)

### Step 2: Draft Structure
Use templates from `jd-templates-by-role.md`:
- Choose the right role template
- Fill in specifics
- Keep it concise

### Step 3: Review for Bias
Use `inclusive-language-guide.md`:
- Check for gendered language
- Remove coded words (rockstar, ninja)
- Shorten requirements list
- Add salary transparency

### Step 4: Get Feedback
- Show to hiring manager (accuracy)
- Show to diverse employees (bias check)
- Read out loud (clarity)

### Step 5: Publish and Iterate
- Post on careers page, LinkedIn, job boards
- Track metrics (applications, quality, diversity)
- Update based on feedback

---

## Metrics to Track

**Quality metrics:**
- Applications from qualified candidates (%)
- Time-to-fill
- Quality-of-hire (90-day performance ratings)

**Diversity metrics:**
- Gender diversity of applicant pool
- Underrepresented minority applicants
- Compare to team demographics

**Iterate:**
- If too few qualified candidates → JD too specific or vague
- If low diversity → check for coded language
- If slow time-to-fill → increase transparency (salary, role clarity)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be specific** - Vague JDs attract vague candidates
2. **Keep requirements short** - 3-4 must-haves max
3. **Be transparent** - Salary, equity, location
4. **Use inclusive language** - No gendered/coded words
5. **Focus on impact** - Why this role matters
6. **Make it scannable** - Bullets, headers, short paragraphs
7. **Write for humans** - Clear, simple language
8. **Test and iterate** - Track metrics, improve over time

Great JDs attract great candidates. It's worth the effort to get this right.
