# Inclusive Language Guide

How to write job descriptions that attract diverse talent and avoid bias.

---

## Why Inclusive Language Matters

**Research shows:**
- Women are less likely to apply if they don't meet 100% of qualifications (men apply at 60%)
- Gendered language reduces applications from underrepresented groups by 30-40%
- Aggressive language ("dominate", "crush") skews male
- Collaborative language ("support", "grow") is perceived as neutral

**Goal:** Write JDs that attract the best candidates, not just people who look like your current team.

---

## Common Bias Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Gendered Language

❌ **Avoid:**
- "He/she will be responsible for..."
- "Spokesman"
- "Guys" (as in "you guys")
- "Chairman", "salesman", "policeman"

✅ **Use:**
- "They will be responsible for..." or "You will be responsible for..."
- "Spokesperson"
- "Team", "folks", "everyone"
- "Chair", "salesperson", "police officer"

---

### 2. Coded Language

#### Aggressive/Masculine-coded words:
❌ **Avoid:**
- Rockstar, ninja, guru, wizard
- Aggressive, dominant, competitive
- Crush, dominate, destroy
- "Work hard, play hard"
- "Must be able to handle a fast-paced environment"

✅ **Use:**
- Skilled, expert, experienced
- Collaborative, driven, ambitious
- Achieve, excel, deliver
- "We move quickly and ship often"
- "Thrive in a dynamic, evolving environment"

#### Why avoid "rockstar/ninja"?
- Alienates older candidates (ageist)
- Skews male (cultural references)
- Vague (doesn't describe actual skills)
- Signals bro culture

---

### 3. Culture Fit

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Culture fit"
- "Must love beer pong"
- "Work hard, play hard"
- "Like a family"

✅ **Use:**
- "Culture add" (what will they bring?)
- Focus on values alignment, not hobbies
- "Collaborative and focused"
- "Supportive team environment"

**Why:** "Culture fit" is often code for "people like us" and perpetuates homogeneity.

---

### 4. Age Bias

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Digital native"
- "Recent grad"
- "Energetic", "youthful"
- "5-7 years experience" (why cap the upper end?)
- "Overqualified"

✅ **Use:**
- "Comfortable with technology"
- Focus on skills, not graduation date
- "Motivated", "passionate"
- "5+ years experience" (no upper limit)
- Don't use this term

---

### 5. Ability/Disability Bias

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Must be able to lift 50 pounds" (unless truly required)
- "Must stand for 8 hours"
- "Ability to work long hours"

✅ **Use:**
- Only include if essential to the job
- Include: "We provide reasonable accommodations"
- Focus on outcomes, not hours

---

### 6. Over-Credentialing

❌ **Avoid:**
- "MBA required"
- "10+ years required"
- "Must have worked at [specific company]"
- Requiring degree for roles that don't need it

✅ **Use:**
- "MBA or equivalent experience"
- "7+ years or demonstrable expertise"
- "Experience at high-growth startups"
- "Degree or equivalent practical experience"

**Why:** Disproportionately excludes women, people of color, and non-traditional backgrounds.

---

## Gender-Neutral Rewrites

### Before and After Examples

❌ **Before:** "We're looking for a rockstar engineer who can hit the ground running and crush our ambitious roadmap. He'll work closely with the team to dominate our market."

✅ **After:** "We're looking for an experienced engineer who can ramp quickly and help us execute an ambitious roadmap. You'll work closely with the team to build products that win in our market."

---

❌ **Before:** "Seeking a ninja salesman who thrives in a competitive, fast-paced environment. Must be aggressive and willing to work long hours."

✅ **After:** "Seeking a skilled salesperson who thrives in a dynamic, growth-oriented environment. You're driven, persistent, and focused on customer success."

---

❌ **Before:** "Looking for a young, energetic marketing guru to join our fun, hard-working team. Must love hackathons and beer pong."

✅ **After:** "Looking for a creative, motivated marketer to join our collaborative team. We value diverse perspectives and a strong work ethic."

## Inclusive Phrasing Guide

### Required Qualifications

❌ **Avoid "Must have":**
- Creates barrier to application
- Signals inflexibility

✅ **Use "Ideally you have" or "We're looking for":**
- Invites candidates to self-assess
- More inclusive tone

### Examples:

**Bad:**
- Must have 10 years of experience
- Must have worked at a top-tier tech company
- Must have a CS degree from a top university

**Good:**
- 7+ years of experience or equivalent expertise
- Experience at high-growth technology companies
- Strong CS fundamentals (degree or practical experience)

---

## Pronouns

### Approach 1: Use "You"
✅ "You will design features that delight users."

### Approach 2: Use "They/Them"
✅ "The Product Manager will own the roadmap. They will work with Engineering and Design."

### Approach 3: Avoid Pronouns
✅ "The Product Manager owns the roadmap and works with Engineering and Design."

**Never use:** He/she, his/her

## Words to Watch

### High-Masculine Coded
(Use sparingly or replace with neutral alternatives)

- Aggressive → Driven, ambitious
- Dominant → Leading, influential
- Competitive → Results-oriented
- Independent → Autonomous, self-directed
- Confident → Assured, capable
- Decisive → Action-oriented
- Objective → Data-driven
- Analytical → Thoughtful, rigorous

### High-Feminine Coded
(These are generally fine, but balance with achievement language)

- Collaborative → good
- Supportive → good
- Nurturing → avoid (unless truly job-related)
- Understanding → Empathetic (better)

### Neutral Language
(Use freely)

- Driven
- Innovative
- Thoughtful
- Skilled
- Experienced
- Strategic
- Customer-focused
- Results-oriented
- Collaborative
- Adaptable

---

## Length and Complexity

**Research shows:**
- Women less likely to apply to long JDs (10+ requirements)
- Complex/jargony language reduces applications from non-native English speakers

✅ **Best practices:**
- Keep required qualifications to 3-4 bullets
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid unnecessary jargon
- Break up long paragraphs

---

## Equity and Transparency

### Salary Ranges

✅ **Always include:**
- Shows transparency
- Saves time for candidates
- Reduces pay gaps
- Many states now require it

❌ **Don't:**
- Hide salary ("Competitive")
- Post unrealistic ranges ($80K-$200K is not helpful)

✅ **Do:**
- Post narrow, realistic ranges
- Explain how equity works
- Be clear about variable comp

---

## Disability Inclusion

### Include This Statement:
```
We provide reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities.
If you need assistance or accommodation during the application or interview process,
please contact us at [email].
```

### Physical Requirements
- Only list if truly essential
- Be specific: "Occasional travel (2-4 times per year)" not "Must be able to travel"

---

## Remote Work Clarity

Be explicit about:
- Fully remote vs. hybrid vs. onsite
- Time zone requirements (if any)
- Travel expectations (if any)
- Office location (if hybrid/onsite)

❌ **Vague:** "Remote-friendly"
✅ **Clear:** "Fully remote (US time zones) with optional office access in SF"
