   - ❌ Bad: "Rockstar", "ninja", "culture fit"
   - ✅ Good: Specific skills and behaviors

3. **Vague responsibilities**
   - ❌ Bad: "Work with stakeholders"
   - ✅ Good: "Partner with Product and Design to ship features"

4. **Laundry list of requirements**
   - ❌ Bad: 15+ bullet points
   - ✅ Good: 3-4 must-haves, 2-3 nice-to-haves

5. **Missing compensation**
   - ❌ Bad: No salary range
   - ✅ Good: Transparent range

6. **Unclear level/seniority**
   - ❌ Bad: "Engineer" (what level?)

## Writing Principles

### 1. Be Specific, Not Generic
- ❌ "Collaborate with teams"
- ✅ "Partner with Design to spec features, Engineering to ship them"

### 2. Focus on Impact, Not Just Tasks
- ❌ "Write code"
- ✅ "Build features used by 100K+ users daily"

### 3. Use Action Verbs
- Build, Design, Lead, Own, Ship, Drive, Create, Analyze

### 4. Keep Required Skills SHORT
- 3-4 must-haves MAX
- Everything else goes in "Nice to Have"

### 5. Be Inclusive
- Avoid gendered language (he/she → they)
- Avoid culture fit → culture add
- Avoid ninja/rockstar → skilled, expert
- Avoid aggressive language (dominate, crush)

### 6. Be Transparent
- Include salary range (transparency attracts better candidates)
- Be clear about remote/hybrid/onsite
- Be honest about stage (don't oversell)

## Compliance & Legal

### EEOC Compliance

**Avoid these protected class references:**
- Age: "Digital native", "recent grad", "energetic"
- Gender: "He/she", gendered pronouns
- Disability: "Ability to lift 50 lbs" (unless truly required)
- Family status: "Willing to travel extensively" (ok if job requires, but be specific)

**Safe alternatives:**
- Use "they/them" pronouns
- Focus on skills and outcomes, not personal attributes
- Include: "We provide reasonable accommodations for disabilities"

### Required Disclaimers

Always end with:
```markdown
[Company] is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees. All employment decisions are based on qualifications, merit, and business need.
```

You're not writing marketing copy. You're writing a job spec that helps candidates self-select (in or out) accurately.

Good JDs attract the right people and repel the wrong ones. That's success.
