# Learning Platforms Guide

Complete guide to selecting learning management systems (LMS), authoring tools, and building your L&D tech stack.

---

## Overview: L&D Tech Stack

**A modern L&D tech stack typically includes:**

1. **LMS (Learning Management System)** - Hosts and tracks training
2. **Authoring tools** - Create eLearning content
3. **Video platform** - Host training videos
4. **Virtual classroom** - Live instructor-led training
5. **Content library** - Pre-built courses (optional)

---

## Learning Management Systems (LMS)

**What is an LMS?**

A platform that:
- Hosts training content (eLearning, videos, documents)
- Assigns training to employees
- Tracks completion and progress
- Generates reports (who completed what, scores, time spent)
- Issues certifications

**Think of it as: "Netflix for corporate training"**

---

### When Do You Need an LMS?

**You probably DON'T need an LMS if:**
- <50 employees
- Minimal training needs (onboarding only)
- Budget-constrained

**Alternative:** Use free tools (Google Drive for docs, Zoom for live training, Google Forms for quizzes)

---

**You probably DO need an LMS if:**
- 50+ employees
- Regular training needs (onboarding, compliance, skill development)
- Need to track completion (for compliance, performance reviews)
- Want to scale training without hiring more trainers

---

### LMS Selection Criteria

**1. Ease of Use**

**For admins (L&D team):**
- Can I upload content easily?
- Can I assign training to groups/individuals?
- Can I create learning paths?
- Can I generate reports without IT help?

**For learners (employees):**
- Is it intuitive? (or do I need training to use the training platform? 🤦)
- Can I access on mobile?
- Can I bookmark and resume where I left off?

**Red flag:** If demo requires 30-min training on how to use the LMS, it's too complex.

---

**2. Content Compatibility**

**What formats does it support?**
- SCORM (standard eLearning format)
- xAPI/Tin Can (newer standard, better tracking)
- Video (MP4, YouTube embeds)
- Documents (PDF, PowerPoint)
- External links (link to other platforms)

**Must-have:** SCORM 1.2 or 2004 support (most eLearning authoring tools export to SCORM)

---

**3. Reporting & Analytics**

**Key reports:**
- **Completion reports:** Who completed what training?
- **Learner transcripts:** Full training history per employee
- **Compliance reports:** Proof of training for audits
- **Engagement analytics:** Time spent, quiz scores, drop-off points

**Nice-to-have:**
- Custom reports (build your own queries)
- Dashboards (visual charts, not just spreadsheets)
- Automated reporting (scheduled emails)

---

**4. Integration with HRIS**

**Does LMS integrate with your HR system?** (Workday, BambooHR, Rippling, ADP, etc.)

**Why integration matters:**
- **Auto-enrollment:** New hires automatically added to LMS
- **Single sign-on (SSO):** Employees log in once, access LMS
- **Data sync:** Keep employee info (name, title, department) up-to-date

**If no integration:** You'll manually add/remove users (pain with high headcount)

---

**5. Pricing Model**

**Common LMS pricing models:**

**Per-user per-month (PUPM):**
- Example: $5-$15 per user per month
- **Pros:** Predictable, scales with company
- **Cons:** Gets expensive with large headcount

**Per-active-user:**
- Only pay for users who log in that month
- **Pros:** Cost savings if not all employees train every month
- **Cons:** Unpredictable monthly bill

**Flat fee:**
- Fixed annual fee (e.g., $10K-$50K/year for unlimited users)
- **Pros:** Predictable, good for large companies
- **Cons:** Expensive upfront, less flexible

**Freemium:**
- Free for basic features, pay for premium (advanced reports, integrations, branding)
- **Pros:** Low barrier to entry
- **Cons:** Limited features on free tier

---

**6. Support & Onboarding**

**What support is included?**
- Email support? (response time?)
- Phone support?
- Dedicated customer success manager (CSM)?
- Onboarding/training to set up LMS?

**Red flag:** "Email support only, 3-5 business day response time" (too slow if you have an urgent issue)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **LMS is a tool, not a strategy** - Don't buy an LMS and expect it to magically create training. You still need to build content and drive adoption.

2. **Start small, scale up** - Don't over-invest in enterprise LMS if you're a 50-person startup. Start with TalentLMS or even free tools, upgrade as you grow.

3. **Ease of use > features** - An LMS with 100 features that no one uses is worse than a simple LMS that everyone actually uses.

4. **Content is king** - The LMS is just the delivery mechanism. Focus on creating great training content.

5. **Integration matters** - SSO and HRIS integration will save you hours of manual work. Worth paying for.

6. **Measure ROI** - Track usage, completion rates, and business impact. Justify your L&D tech investment.

**Great L&D tech = enables scale, drives engagement, proves impact. Choose tools that make your job easier, not harder.**
