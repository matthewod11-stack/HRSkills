# Scaling Framework

How to design and evolve organizational structures from 10 → 100 → 1,000+ employees.

---

## Overview: Organizational Life Cycles

**As companies grow, organizational structures must evolve**

**Key transitions:**
1. **0-10 employees:** Flat, everyone reports to CEO
2. **10-50 employees:** Functional leaders emerge (VP Eng, VP Sales)
3. **50-200 employees:** Team leads and managers added
4. **200-500 employees:** Middle management layer (Directors)
5. **500-2,000 employees:** Hybrid or divisional structures
6. **2,000+ employees:** Complex matrix or multi-divisional

**Each transition requires intentional restructuring**

---

## Stage 1: Founding Team (0-10 employees)

### Company Profile

**Characteristics:**
- Pre-product/market fit
- Scrappy, everyone wears multiple hats
- Revenue: $0-$500K ARR
- Funding: Pre-seed or Seed

**Typical headcount:**
- 2 Co-founders (CEO, CTO)
- 3-5 Engineers
- 1-2 Salespeople or Growth
- 1 Product/Design (maybe)

**Total: 6-10 people**

---

### Org Structure

```
CEO (Co-founder)
├── CTO (Co-founder)
│   └── Engineers [3-5]
├── Head of Sales [1-2]
└── Product/Design [1]
```

**Structure: Flat (2 layers max)**
- Everyone reports to CEO or CTO
- No middle managers

---

### What Works at This Stage

✅ **Direct communication:** Everyone in same room (or Slack channel), decisions are fast
✅ **Flexible roles:** Engineer also does customer support, CEO also sells
✅ **High autonomy:** Small team, everyone self-directs

---

### What Breaks at This Stage

❌ **CEO bottleneck:** If everyone reports to CEO (8 direct reports), CEO can't focus on strategy
❌ **Lack of process:** No onboarding, no 1:1s, no structure (OK for now, won't scale)
❌ **Burnout:** Everyone working 60-80 hour weeks

---

### When to Evolve

**Trigger:** Hit 10 employees or $1M ARR

**Next stage:** Add functional leaders (VP Eng, VP Sales)

---

## Stage 2: Functional Startup (10-50 employees)

### Company Profile

**Characteristics:**
- Found product/market fit
- Scaling revenue and team
- Revenue: $1M-$10M ARR
- Funding: Series A

**Typical headcount:**
- Engineering: 8-15
- Sales: 5-10
- Marketing: 2-4
- Customer Success: 2-4
- Operations (Finance/HR): 1-2

**Total: 20-40 people**

---

### Org Structure

```
CEO
├── VP Engineering [1]
│   ├── Backend Engineers [5]
│   ├── Frontend Engineers [4]
│   └── QA/DevOps [2]
│
├── VP Sales [1]
│   ├── Account Executives [4]
│   └── SDRs [3]
│
├── VP Marketing [1]
│   ├── Content/Demand Gen [2]
│   └── Product Marketing [1]
│
├── Head of Customer Success [1]
│   └── CSMs [3]
│
└── Head of Operations [1]
    └── Finance/HR (part-time or fractional) [1]
```

**Structure: Functional (3 layers)**
- CEO → VPs → ICs
- No team leads or managers yet

---

### Key Changes from Stage 1

**1. Functional leaders added**
- VPs own their function (Engineering, Sales, Marketing)
- CEO no longer involved in every decision

**2. Specialization begins**
- Engineers stop doing customer support
- Sales team focuses on selling (not building product)

**3. First processes**
- Weekly all-hands
- Sprint planning (Engineering)
- Sales pipeline reviews

---

### What Works at This Stage

✅ **Clear ownership:** VP Engineering owns product, VP Sales owns revenue
✅ **Specialization:** Deep expertise developing in each function
✅ **Manageable spans:** CEO has 4-6 direct reports (VPs)

---

### What Breaks at This Stage

❌ **VP overwhelm:** VP Engineering manages 12 engineers directly (too many)
❌ **Silos forming:** Engineering and Sales don't talk
❌ **No career path:** ICs ask "How do I grow?" (no management roles available)

---

### When to Evolve

**Trigger:** Hit 50 employees or VP has 10+ direct reports

**Next stage:** Add team leads/managers under VPs

---

## Stage 3: Layered Functional (50-200 employees)

### Company Profile

**Characteristics:**
- Scaling fast
- Multiple products or product lines
- Revenue: $10M-$50M ARR
- Funding: Series B/C

**Typical headcount:**
- Engineering: 30-50
- Sales: 20-30
- Marketing: 8-12
- Customer Success: 10-15
- Product: 5-8
- Operations (Finance, HR, Legal): 10-15

**Total: 80-150 people**

---

### Org Structure

│   └── Accounting [2]
│
└── CHRO (Chief People Officer) [1]
    ├── Recruiting Manager [1] → Recruiters [3]
    ├── HR Business Partners [2]
    └── Total Rewards [1]
```

**Structure: Functional with Managers (4 layers)**
- CEO → C-suite → VPs → Managers → ICs
- Team leads and managers added

---

### Key Changes from Stage 2

**1. Middle management layer**
- Team leads (Engineering: Backend Lead, Frontend Lead)
- Managers (Sales Manager, CS Manager)
- VPs now manage managers (not ICs directly)

**2. Specialization deepens**
- Sales split by segment (Enterprise vs. SMB)
- Engineering split by function (Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Infra)

**3. Formal HR function**
- First CHRO hire
- Recruiting team (no more "everyone recruits")
- HR policies and processes

**4. Executive team forms**
- C-suite (CTO, CRO, CFO, CHRO)
- Weekly exec meetings (strategy, cross-functional decisions)

---

### What Works at This Stage

✅ **Manageable spans:** VPs have 3-5 reports (managers), managers have 6-10 reports (ICs)
✅ **Career paths:** ICs can become team leads → managers → directors
✅ **Cross-functional leadership:** CRO owns Sales + Marketing + CS (alignment)

---

### What Breaks at This Stage

❌ **Silos deepen:** Engineering, Sales, Marketing work in isolation
❌ **Slow decisions:** Cross-functional initiatives require CEO involvement (bottleneck)
❌ **One-size-fits-all:** Enterprise customers need different sales motion than SMB (same process for both)

---

### When to Evolve

**Trigger:** Hit 200 employees or serving multiple distinct customer segments

**Next stage:** Consider hybrid or divisional structure

---

## Stage 4: Hybrid/Divisional (200-1,000 employees)

### Company Profile

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple products or customer segments
- Mature business model
- Revenue: $50M-$300M ARR
- Funding: Series D+ or profitable

**Typical headcount:**
- Engineering: 100-200
- Sales: 50-100
- Marketing: 20-40
- Customer Success: 30-60
- Product: 15-30
- Operations (Finance, HR, Legal, IT): 30-60

**Total: 250-500 people**

---

### Org Structure (Hybrid Model)

**Centralized functions + Business units**

```
CEO
├── CTO [1] (Centralized)
│   ├── SVP Engineering [1]
│   │   ├── VP Backend [1] → Directors [3] → Managers [10] → Engineers [60]
│   │   ├── VP Frontend [1] → Directors [2] → Managers [6] → Engineers [40]
│   │   └── VP Infrastructure [1] → Managers [4] → Engineers [30]
│   │
│   └── SVP Product [1]
│       ├── VP Product Management [1] → Directors [2] → PMs [12]
│       └── VP Design [1] → Design Managers [3] → Designers [15]
│
├── Business Unit: Enterprise
│   └── GM Enterprise [1] (P&L owner)
│       ├── VP Sales - Enterprise [1] → Managers [4] → AEs [25]
│       ├── VP Marketing - Enterprise [1] → Team [10]
│       └── VP CS - Enterprise [1] → Managers [3] → CSMs [20]
│
├── Business Unit: SMB
│   └── GM SMB [1] (P&L owner)
│       ├── VP Sales - SMB [1] → Managers [6] → AEs [40]
│       ├── VP Marketing - SMB [1] → Team [12]
│       └── VP CS - SMB [1] → Managers [4] → CSMs [30]
│
├── CFO [1]
│   └── Finance, Accounting, FP&A [20]
│
└── CHRO [1]
    └── Recruiting, HR, Comp, L&D [25]
```

**Structure: Hybrid (4-5 layers)**
- Centralized: Engineering, Product (shared across BUs)
- Divisional: Sales, Marketing, CS (segment-specific)

---

### Key Changes from Stage 3

**1. Business units emerge**
- GM (General Manager) owns P&L for segment
- Dedicated Sales, Marketing, CS for each segment

**2. Executive layer (SVPs)**
- SVP Engineering, SVP Product (manage multiple VPs)
- Deeper hierarchy (CEO → SVP → VP → Director → Manager → IC)

**3. Shared services**
- Finance, HR, Legal, IT centralized (serve all BUs)

**4. Dotted-line reporting**
- Enterprise AE reports to VP Sales - Enterprise (solid line)
- Enterprise AE collaborates with Product team (dotted line)

---

### What Works at This Stage

✅ **Segment focus:** Enterprise team serves Enterprise customers (no compromises for SMB)
✅ **Accountability:** GMs own revenue and retention for their segment
✅ **Efficiency:** Shared Engineering and Product (no duplication)

---

### What Breaks at This Stage

❌ **Complexity:** Dotted-line reporting is confusing ("Who's my real boss?")
❌ **Resource contention:** Both BUs want Engineering resources (priority conflicts)
❌ **Communication overhead:** 500 people = too big for all-hands to work well

---

### When to Evolve

**Trigger:** Hit 1,000 employees or expanding to multiple products/markets

**Next stage:** Full divisional or matrix

---

## Stage 5: Divisional/Matrix (1,000+ employees)

### Company Profile

**Characteristics:**
- Multiple distinct businesses
- Global presence
- Revenue: $300M+ ARR
- Funding: Late-stage or public

**Typical headcount:**
- Engineering: 300-500
- Sales: 150-250
- Marketing: 50-100
- Customer Success: 100-150
- Product: 50-100
- Operations: 100-150

**Total: 800-1,500 people**

---

### Org Structure (Divisional)

```
CEO
├── Business Unit 1: Platform Product
│   └── President/GM [1]
│       ├── SVP Engineering [1] → VPs [3] → Directors [10] → Managers [30] → Engineers [200]
│       ├── SVP Product [1] → VPs [2] → PMs [20]
│       ├── SVP Sales [1] → VPs [2] → Directors [8] → Managers [25] → AEs/SDRs [150]
│       ├── VP Marketing [1] → Team [30]
│       └── VP CS [1] → Managers [10] → CSMs [60]
│
├── Business Unit 2: Developer Tools
│   └── President/GM [1]
│       ├── SVP Engineering [1] → [similar structure, ~120 engineers]
│       ├── VP Product [1] → PMs [12]
│       ├── VP Sales [1] → Team [50]
│       ├── VP Marketing [1] → Team [15]
│       └── VP CS [1] → Team [30]
│
├── Business Unit 3: AI/Analytics Product
│   └── President/GM [1]
│       └── [similar structure, ~80 engineers, ~40 sales, ~20 CS]
│
└── Shared Services
    ├── CFO [1] → Finance [50]
    ├── CHRO [1] → HR [40]
    ├── General Counsel [1] → Legal [20]
    └── CIO [1] → IT/Security [30]
```

**Structure: Divisional (5-6 layers)**
- Each BU is a mini-company (has its own Eng, Sales, Product, Marketing, CS)
- Shared services (Finance, HR, Legal, IT) centralized

---

### Key Changes from Stage 4

**1. Full business unit autonomy**
- Each BU has its own engineering, product, sales, marketing, CS
- BU Presidents/GMs are mini-CEOs (own P&L, make strategic decisions)

**2. Intentional duplication**
- BU1 has 200 engineers, BU2 has 120 engineers (separate teams)
- Trade-off: Autonomy and speed > efficiency

**3. Deep hierarchies**
- 5-6 layers: CEO → President → SVP → VP → Director → Manager → IC
- Each layer adds 7-10x scale (with span of 7-10)

---

### What Works at This Stage

✅ **Speed:** BUs move independently (don't wait for other BUs)
✅ **Accountability:** Clear P&L ownership per BU
✅ **Innovation:** BUs can experiment, take risks without affecting other BUs

---

### What Breaks at This Stage

❌ **Duplication cost:** 3 engineering orgs, 3 sales orgs (expensive)
❌ **Inconsistency:** BUs have different cultures, processes, tools
❌ **Bureaucracy:** 6 layers = slow decisions within each BU

---

### Scaling Principles: Rules of Thumb

**1. Layers grow logarithmically**

```
Company Size → Layers (with span of 7)
10 people → 2 layers
50 people → 3 layers
350 people → 4 layers
2,500 people → 5 layers
17,500 people → 6 layers
```

**Formula:** Layers = log₇(Total Employees)

---

**2. Management ratio grows**

| Company Size | Managers as % of Company |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| 10 employees | 10% (1 manager: CEO) |
| 50 employees | 15% (7-8 managers) |
| 200 employees | 18% (~35 managers) |
| 1,000 employees | 20% (~200 managers) |

**Why:** As you add layers, % of managers increases

---

**3. Functional specialization increases**

**10 people:** Everyone is generalist (engineer also does sales, CEO does HR)

**50 people:** Basic functions (Eng, Sales, Marketing, Ops)

**200 people:** Sub-functions (Backend Eng, Frontend Eng, Enterprise Sales, SMB Sales)

**1,000 people:** Deep specialization (API Platform Eng, Mobile iOS Eng, Enterprise SaaS Sales - East, Enterprise SaaS Sales - West)

---

## Scaling Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Communication Breakdown

**Symptom:**
- At 10 people: Everyone knows everything
- At 200 people: Teams don't know what other teams are doing
- At 1,000 people: Silos, duplicate work, conflicting priorities

**Solutions:**

**50-200 employees:**
- Weekly all-hands (30-45 min, CEO updates + Q&A)
- Monthly team updates (each team shares what they shipped)
- Internal wiki (Confluence, Notion) for documentation

**200-1,000 employees:**
- Bi-weekly all-hands (can't do weekly with 500 people)
- Quarterly business reviews (each BU presents results)
- Slack channels per team (#engineering-backend, #sales-enterprise)
- Internal newsletter (weekly email: company updates, wins, new hires)

**1,000+ employees:**
- Monthly all-hands (quarterly for very large companies)
- Exec blog (CEO writes monthly post on strategy)
- Team wikis and documentation (critical - can't rely on Slack)

---

### Challenge 2: Decision Speed Slows

**Symptom:**
- At 10 people: Decision in 1 day (everyone in same room)
- At 200 people: Decision takes 1 week (need cross-functional alignment)
- At 1,000 people: Decision takes 1 month (6 layers of approval)

**Solutions:**

**Distributed decision-making:**
- Push decisions down (managers decide, don't escalate everything to CEO)
- Define decision rights (RACI: who's Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)

**Example RACI:**
| Decision | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Pricing for <$50K deal | AE | Sales Manager | Finance | VP Sales |
| Pricing for $500K+ deal | AE | VP Sales | CFO, CEO | Board |

**Reduce approval layers:**
- **Bad:** AE → Manager → Director → VP → CRO → CEO (6 layers ❌)
- **Good:** AE → Manager → VP (3 layers ✅)

---

### Challenge 3: Loss of Startup Culture

**Symptom:**
- At 10 people: Everyone knows everyone, tight-knit family
- At 200 people: Starting to feel corporate
- At 1,000 people: "We've lost the startup vibe"

**Solutions:**

**Intentional culture preservation:**
- **Write down values early** (while still 20-50 people) so culture is defined
- **Hire for culture fit** (values alignment, not just skills)
- **Maintain traditions** (weekly team lunch, monthly offsites, all-hands format)

**Accept evolution:**
- Culture WILL change (that's OK)
- Focus on preserving core values, not every tradition
- Example: Can't do "everyone knows everyone" at 500 people (accept it, create smaller communities)

---

## Scaling Anti-Patterns: What Not to Do

### Anti-Pattern 1: Over-layer too early

**Mistake:**
- 50-person company with 5 layers (CEO → President → VP → Director → Manager → IC)

**Why it's bad:**
- Slow decisions
- High overhead (too many managers)
- Bureaucracy

**Fix:** Keep it flat as long as possible (2-3 layers until 200 employees)

---

### Anti-Pattern 2: Under-layer too late

**Mistake:**
- 500-person company, still 2 layers (CEO → ICs)
- CEO has 30 direct reports

**Why it's bad:**
- CEO overwhelmed
- No management development (no career path for ICs)
- Quality of management suffers

**Fix:** Add layers proactively (when spans >10, add layer)

---

### Anti-Pattern 3: Copy Google's structure

**Mistake:**
- "Google has a matrix structure, let's do matrix!"
- Applies structure that doesn't fit the business

**Why it's bad:**
- Google is 100,000 people with multiple products
- Your 50-person startup is not Google
- Structure must fit YOUR business

**Fix:** Design structure based on YOUR strategy, size, complexity

---

## Scaling Checklist by Stage

### 0-10 Employees

- [ ] Flat structure (everyone reports to CEO or co-founder)
- [ ] No formal processes (move fast, figure it out)
- [ ] Focus: Find product/market fit

---

### 10-50 Employees

- [ ] Add functional leaders (VP Eng, VP Sales)
- [ ] Introduce basic processes (weekly all-hands, sprint planning)
- [ ] First HR policies (PTO, expenses)
- [ ] Focus: Scale revenue and team

---

### 50-200 Employees

- [ ] Add team leads and managers under VPs
- [ ] Formalize HR function (CHRO, recruiting team)
- [ ] Implement performance review process
- [ ] Create career ladders (IC track, management track)
- [ ] Focus: Build scalable processes

---

### 200-1,000 Employees

- [ ] Consider hybrid or divisional structure
- [ ] Add executive layer (SVPs, GMs)
- [ ] Implement OKRs or goal-setting framework
- [ ] Build L&D function (training programs)
- [ ] Focus: Multi-product scale, operational excellence

---

### 1,000+ Employees

- [ ] Full divisional or matrix structure
- [ ] Deep specialization (sub-functions, regions)
- [ ] Robust shared services (Finance, HR, Legal, IT)
- [ ] Executive talent (hire experienced VPs/GMs from large companies)
- [ ] Focus: Strategic portfolio management, innovation

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structure evolves with size** - 10-person startup ≠ 1,000-person company
2. **Add layers intentionally** - Don't over-layer early, don't under-layer late
3. **Transition every 2-3x growth** - 10 → 50 → 200 → 1,000 (each needs new structure)
4. **Communication must scale** - All-hands works at 50, not at 500 (adapt)
5. **Culture changes** - Accept it, focus on preserving core values

**Great scaling = intentional structure evolution at each growth stage.**
