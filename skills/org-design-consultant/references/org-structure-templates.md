## Template 5: Matrix Org Chart (Product + Functional)

### Stage: Product Company with Shared Resources

**Company profile:**
- 800 employees
- 5 product lines
- Shared engineering resources
- Structure: **Matrix (Product Teams + Functional Teams)**

### Org Chart (Simplified)

│   ├── Frontend Engineers [40] ───────┤
│   ├── Mobile Engineers [20] ─────────┤

│   └── QA Engineers [10] ─────────────┤
│                                       │
├── VP Product (Cross-Functional Teams) ┤
│   │                                   │
│   ├── Product Team A (AI Features)   │
│   │   ├── Product Manager [1] ───────┤ (requests engineers)
│   │   ├── Backend Engineers [8] ◄────┘
│   │   ├── Frontend Engineers [4]
│   │   ├── Designers [2]
│   │   └── QA [1]
│   │
│   ├── Product Team B (Mobile App)
│   │   ├── Product Manager [1]
│   │   ├── Mobile Engineers [10] ◄─── (from Mobile Eng pool)
│   │   ├── Backend Engineers [4]
│   │   ├── Designers [2]
│   │   └── QA [1]
│   │
│   ├── Product Team C (Analytics Platform)
│   │   ├── Product Manager [1]
│   │   ├── Data Engineers [8] ◄────── (from Data Eng pool)
│   │   ├── Backend Engineers [6]
│   │   ├── Frontend Engineers [3]
│   │   └── QA [1]
│   │
│   └── [Product Teams D, E...]
```

**How it works:**
- **VP Engineering:** Career manager for all engineers
  - Does performance reviews
  - Manages compensation
  - Develops engineering career paths
  - Assigns engineers to product teams

- **Product Managers:** Day-to-day work manager
  - Sets priorities ("This sprint, work on Feature X")
  - Runs standups, sprint planning
  - Does NOT do performance reviews

**Engineers have two reporting lines:**
- **Solid line:** VP Engineering (career, comp, reviews)
- **Dotted line:** Product Manager (day-to-day work)

**Pros:**
- Engineers develop deep functional expertise (backend, frontend)
- Flexible resource allocation (shift engineers between product teams)

**Cons:**
- Confusing (who's my real boss?)
- Potential conflicts (VP Eng wants me to do X, PM wants Y)

---

## Template 6: Hybrid Org Chart (Functional Core + BU Sales/Marketing)

### Stage: Growing Company, 300-500 employees

**Company profile:**
- 400 employees
- 2 customer segments (Enterprise, SMB)
- Shared product/engineering
- Segment-specific sales/marketing
- Structure: **Hybrid**

---

### Org Chart

```
CEO
├── Centralized Functions
│   ├── CTO [1]
│   │   ├── VP Engineering [1] → All Engineers [80]
│   │   └── VP Product [1] → All PMs [15]
│   │
│   ├── CFO [1] → Finance Team [20]
│   ├── CHRO [1] → HR Team [15]
│   └── General Counsel [1] → Legal [8]

├── Business Unit: Enterprise
│   ├── GM - Enterprise [1]
│   │   ├── VP Sales - Enterprise [1] → Team [40]
│   │   ├── VP Marketing - Enterprise [1] → Team [15]
│   │   └── VP Customer Success - Enterprise [1] → Team [25]
│   │
│   Total: ~80 employees
│
└── Business Unit: SMB
    ├── GM - SMB [1]
    │   ├── VP Sales - SMB [1] → Team [60]
    │   ├── VP Marketing - SMB [1] → Team [20]
    │   └── VP Customer Success - SMB [1] → Team [30]
    │
    Total: ~110 employees
```

**Total:** ~400 employees

**Why this works:**
- **Product/Eng centralized:** Shared product serves both segments (efficiency)
- **Sales/Marketing by segment:** Different buyers, different messaging (effectiveness)
- **Best of both worlds:** Efficiency where it matters, customization where it matters

## Choosing the Right Structure: Decision Tree

**Start here:**

**Question 1: How many employees?**
- <50 → **Flat/Functional** (Template 1)
- 50-300 → **Functional with Team Leads** (Template 2)
- 300-1,000 → **Functional or Hybrid** (Template 3 or 6)
- 1,000+ → **Divisional or Matrix** (Template 4 or 5)

**Question 2: How many products?**
- 1 product → **Functional** (Templates 1-3)
- 2-3 products (similar) → **Functional or Hybrid** (Templates 2-3, 6)
- 3+ products (different customers) → **Divisional** (Template 4)

**Question 3: What do you optimize for?**
- **Efficiency & expertise** → **Functional** (Templates 1-3)
- **Accountability & speed** → **Divisional** (Template 4)
- **Flexibility & resource sharing** → **Matrix** (Template 5)
- **Balance** → **Hybrid** (Template 6)

## Common Org Chart Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Too many layers

**Bad example:**
```
CEO → President → EVP → SVP → VP → Senior Director → Director → Senior Manager → Manager → Team Lead → IC

(10 layers for a 500-person company ❌)
```

**Rule of thumb:**
- <100 employees: 2 layers (CEO → Manager → IC)
- 100-500: 3 layers (CEO → VP → Manager → IC)
- 500-2,000: 4 layers (CEO → SVP → Director → Manager → IC)
- 2,000+: 5 layers (rarely need more)

**Why it's bad:**
- Slow decisions (goes through 10 people)
- High overhead (lots of middle management salaries)
- Information loss (game of telephone)

---

### Mistake 2: Unbalanced spans

**Bad example:**
```
VP Sales
├── Manager A → 3 reps ❌ (too few)
├── Manager B → 4 reps ❌ (too few)
└── Manager C → 18 reps ❌ (too many)
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Managers A and B are underutilized (or micromanaging)
- Manager C is overwhelmed (can't coach 18 reps well)

**Fix:**
- Redistribute: Manager A gets 8, Manager B gets 8, Manager C gets 9

---

### Mistake 3: Unclear reporting lines

**Bad example:**
```
Product Marketing Manager
    ├── Reports to VP Marketing
    └── Also reports to VP Product (which is real boss?)
```

**Fix:** Be explicit
- **Solid line:** VP Marketing (performance reviews, comp decisions)
- **Dotted line:** VP Product (functional collaboration)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structure follows strategy** - What does the business need? Start there.
2. **Keep it simple** - Fewer layers, clear reporting lines
3. **Balanced spans** - 5-8 direct reports per manager (generally)
4. **Plan for growth** - Will this work at 2x size? 5x size?
5. **Iterate** - Org structures aren't permanent. Evolve as company grows.

**Great org charts = clear, scalable, aligned with business goals.**
