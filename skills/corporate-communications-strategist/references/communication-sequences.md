# Communication Sequencing

Who hears what news, in what order, with timing guidelines.

---

## Why Sequencing Matters

**Bad sequencing kills trust:**
- Employees learn about layoffs from Twitter
- Customers hear before internal teams
- Managers surprised by announcements they have to defend
- Rumors spread faster than official communications

**Good sequencing builds credibility:**
- Most affected hear first, directly
- Each group gets appropriate context
- Timing prevents leaks while moving fast
- Everyone feels informed, not blindsided

---

## Universal Sequencing Principle

**Core rule:** Information flows from **most affected → least affected**, **internal → external**

**Exception:** Legal/regulatory requirements may force simultaneous disclosure (e.g., SEC filings)

---

## Standard Sequences by Scenario

### Layoff / RIF Sequencing

**Timeline: Single Day (Critical)**

```
8:00 AM  → Board notification (if public company)
8:30 AM  → Affected employees (1:1 calls, staggered)
11:00 AM → People managers briefing (those not affected)
1:00 PM  → Full company all-hands + email
2:00 PM  → Customers and partners (if needed)
2:30 PM  → Press statement / public announcement
```

**Critical details:**

**8:30 AM - Affected Employees:**
- Who: Direct manager + HR
- How: 1:1 video call or in-person (NEVER email/Slack)
- Duration: 10 minutes max
- What: Termination notice, severance, next steps
- Why first: Respect and legal obligation

**11:00 AM - People Managers:**
- Who: All managers, VPs, senior leadership
- How: Closed leadership meeting
- Duration: 30-45 minutes
- What: Context, affected departments, FAQ, talking points
- Why: Equip them to support their teams

**1:00 PM - Full Company:**
- Who: All employees
- How: All-hands (live) + follow-up email
- Duration: 45-60 minutes (including Q&A)
- What: What happened, why, who's affected (no names), what's next
- Why: Transparency, prevent rumors, address survivor concerns

**2:00 PM - External:**
- Who: Customers, partners, press
- How: Email (customers), press release (media)
- What: Brief factual statement, no service disruption
- Why: After internal, prevents customer panic

### CEO / C-Level Departure Sequencing

**Timeline: 24-48 Hours**

**Planned Departure (Retirement, New Role):**
```
Day 1, 9 AM   → Board notification
Day 1, 10 AM  → Executive team
Day 1, 2 PM   → Full company all-hands
Day 1, 3 PM   → Customers and partners (key accounts)
Day 1, 4 PM   → Press release
Day 2         → Broader customer communication
```

**Sudden Departure (Termination, Resignation):**
```
Hour 0        → Board decision / resignation
Hour 1        → Legal review of messaging
Hour 2        → Executive team notification
Hour 4        → Full company all-hands (urgent)
Hour 5        → Press statement (if needed)
Hour 6        → Customer communication (if CEO was customer-facing)
```

**Key differences:**
- Planned: Longer timeline, celebration tone, thank you's
- Sudden: Faster, factual, less detail, focus on transition

---

### Acquisition / M&A Sequencing

**Timeline: Day of Close (Legal Requirement)**

```
[Legal close completes]
Hour 0        → Board notifications (both companies)
Hour 0.5      → Executive teams (both companies)
Hour 1        → Acquired company all-hands
Hour 1.5      → Acquiring company all-hands
Hour 2        → Joint press release / SEC filing
Hour 2        → Customer communications (both sides)
Hour 3        → Partners, vendors
```

**Critical timing notes:**
- **Cannot announce before close** (legal violation)
- Must be **simultaneous or near-simultaneous** across both orgs
- Employees must hear **before public/press**
- SEC filing (if public) often triggers press coverage

---

### Security Breach / Data Leak Sequencing

**Timeline: Hours to Days (Depends on Severity)**

```
Hour 0        → Breach discovered
Hour 0-2      → Contain the breach (technical)
Hour 2        → Crisis team assembled (legal, security, comms, CEO)
Hour 2-4      → Legal review (disclosure requirements)
Hour 4-6      → Internal notification (employees)
Hour 6-12     → Affected users notified (email, direct)
Hour 12-24    → Public statement / press
Hour 24-72    → Regulatory notification (GDPR: 72 hours)
```

**Notification requirements by law:**
- **GDPR**: 72 hours to notify regulators
- **California CCPA**: "Without unreasonable delay"
- **SEC (public companies)**: Material event disclosure

**Who hears what:**
- **Employees first**: Brief on what happened, how to respond to inquiries
- **Affected users**: Direct email with specific details and action items
- **Public**: High-level statement after affected parties notified

---

### Product Shutdown Sequencing

**Timeline: 60-90 Days Notice (Standard)**

```
Day 0         → Internal announcement (company)
Day 0         → Customer notification email (all affected)
Day 1         → Public blog post / announcement
Day 30        → Reminder: 60 days until shutdown
Day 60        → Reminder: 30 days until shutdown
Day 80        → Final reminder: 10 days until shutdown
Day 90        → Service shutdown
Day 120       → Data deletion (after export period)
```

**Communication frequency:**
- Initial announcement
- 60-day reminder
- 30-day reminder
- 10-day reminder
- Day-of confirmation

---

### Return-to-Office (RTO) Mandate Sequencing

**Timeline: 30-60 Days Notice**

```
Week 0, Mon   → Leadership alignment (get buy-in)
Week 0, Wed   → Manager preview + talking points
Week 0, Fri   → Company announcement (all-hands + email)
Week 1        → Listening sessions / office hours
Week 2        → Individual hardship conversations
Week 4        → 30-day reminder
Week 8        → Policy takes effect
```

**Why this timeline:**
- 30+ days allows people to adjust (childcare, commute, etc.)
- Managers need preview to prepare for questions
- Listening sessions address concerns
- Hardship cases handled individually

---

### Crisis (Scandal, Lawsuit, Outage) Sequencing

**Timeline: Same Day (Speed Critical)**

```
Hour 0        → Crisis occurs / discovered
Hour 1        → Crisis team assembled
Hour 2        → Legal review
Hour 3        → Internal notification (employees)
Hour 4        → Public statement (if needed)
Hour 4+       → Regular updates (every 2-4 hours until resolved)
```

**Update cadence during crisis:**
- **Every 2-4 hours** during active crisis
- Even if "no new info, still working on it"
- Silence creates speculation

---

## Stakeholder Mapping

For any major announcement, map these groups:

### Tier 1: Directly Affected (Hear First)
- Employees losing jobs
- Departing executive
- Customers with service disruption
- Users with compromised data

### Tier 2: Internal Stakeholders (Hear Second)
- Remaining employees
- People managers
- Board (or simultaneously with Tier 1 if governance issue)

### Tier 3: External Stakeholders (Hear Third)
- Customers (if not directly affected)
- Partners and vendors
- Investors (if not board)

### Tier 4: Public (Hear Last)
- Press and media
- General public
- Competitors (by default)

**Exception:** If press leaks early, compress timeline and communicate immediately to all tiers.

---

## Channel Selection by Stakeholder

### For Employees:

**Termination / Layoff:**
- Channel: 1:1 video call or in-person (NEVER email, Slack, text)
- Backup: Phone call if remote and video unavailable
- Duration: 10 minutes

**Major announcements (M&A, RTO, CEO change):**
- Channel: All-hands (live video) + follow-up email
- Duration: 45-60 minutes with Q&A
- Email: Sent immediately after, summarizes all-hands

**Updates and reminders:**
- Channel: Email, Slack announcement
- Format: Written, clear, linked to more info

---

### For Customers:

**Direct impact (breach, outage, shutdown):**
- Channel: Direct email to affected users
- Backup: In-app notification, status page
- Phone: For enterprise customers (account manager calls)

**Indirect impact (leadership change, company news):**
- Channel: Email from CEO or account owner
- Blog post for broader awareness

---

### For Press / Public:

**Press release:**
- When: After internal and customer notification
- Format: Official statement, facts only
- Distribution: PR wire, company blog, social media

**Media inquiries:**
- Who responds: Designated spokesperson only (CEO, Comms lead)
- What: Approved statement, no speculation

---

## Timing Guidelines by Scenario

### Same-Day Sequencing (Fastest)
**Scenarios:** Layoffs, crises, sudden departures, outages

**Why fast:** Prevent leaks, control narrative, show urgency

**Sequence:** 4-8 hours from first notification to public

---

### 24-48 Hour Sequencing (Standard)
**Scenarios:** Planned leadership transitions, policy changes, M&A (after close)

**Why moderate:** Balance speed with thoroughness, allow for questions

**Sequence:** Day 1 internal, Day 2 external

---

### Multi-Week Sequencing (Deliberate)
**Scenarios:** Product shutdowns, RTO mandates, major policy rollouts

**Why slow:** Give people time to prepare, gather feedback, adjust

**Sequence:** Announce → 30-day reminder → 60-day reminder → Effective date

---

## Red Flags: Signs of Bad Sequencing

**You messed up sequencing if:**

❌ Employees learn from Twitter before internal announcement
❌ Managers surprised by announcement they must defend
❌ Customers contact support before support knows about issue
❌ Press publishes before affected employees notified
❌ Board learns about crisis from news coverage
❌ Laid-off employees find out when badge access fails

**Fixes:**
- Compress timeline (minutes, not hours between tiers)
- Multiple notification methods (email + Slack + all-hands)
- Verify each tier received message before next tier notified

---

## Special Considerations

### Public Companies
- SEC requires **material event disclosure** within 4 business days (8-K filing)
- Certain events require **immediate disclosure** (CEO change, earnings miss, security breach)
- **Board must know first** before any public announcement
- **Legal review required** for all public statements

---

### Highly Regulated Industries (Healthcare, Finance)
- Regulatory notification often required **before public announcement**
- Customer notification may have **legal timeline requirements**
- **Approval workflows** can add days to timeline

---

### Remote/Distributed Teams
- **Time zones matter**: Don't notify at 3 AM local time
- **Recorded all-hands**: For those who can't attend live
- **Written follow-up**: Always, even after live session
- **Repeat in multiple channels**: Email + Slack + Zoom

---

### Small Companies (<50 people)
- **Faster sequencing possible**: Everyone in one meeting
- **Less formality needed**: Skip press releases if not public-facing
- **Higher trust requirement**: Smaller groups = harder to control leaks

---

## Key Principles

1. **Most affected hear first** - Always
2. **Internal before external** - Employees before press
3. **Same day when possible** - Don't let rumors spread overnight
4. **Compress timeline if leaked** - Speed beats perfection
5. **Equip managers before announcements** - They field questions
6. **Multiple channels** - Email + live + written
7. **Verify receipt** - Confirm each tier heard before moving to next

Great sequencing = right message, right people, right order, right time.
