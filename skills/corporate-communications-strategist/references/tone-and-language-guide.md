# Tone and Language Guide

Writing principles, voice guidelines, and examples for effective corporate communications.

---

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Plain Language Over Corporate Speak

**Why:** People distrust jargon. It sounds like you're hiding something.

**Bad:** "We're executing a strategic workforce optimization initiative to align our human capital with our operational efficiency objectives."

**Good:** "We're reducing our team by 20% due to slower than expected revenue growth."

**Rule:** If a 10th grader can't understand it, rewrite it.

---

### 2. Active Voice Over Passive Voice

**Why:** Active voice shows ownership and accountability.

**Bad (Passive):** "Mistakes were made that led to this outcome."

**Good (Active):** "We made mistakes that led to this outcome."

**Bad (Passive):** "Your role has been eliminated."

**Good (Active):** "We've made the decision to eliminate your role."

**Rule:** Identify who's doing the action and put them first.

---

### 3. Specificity Over Vagueness

**Why:** Vague language creates anxiety and speculation.

**Bad:** "We're making some organizational changes."

**Good:** "We're reducing headcount by 15% — 23 people across engineering and sales."

**Bad:** "We're taking steps to address the situation."

**Good:** "We've shut down the compromised system and engaged a cybersecurity firm to investigate."

**Rule:** Answer: What exactly? How many? When? Who's affected?

---

### 4. Lead with the News

**Why:** People skim. Don't bury the most important information.

**Bad:**
```
Team,

As you know, we've been working hard this year to achieve our ambitious goals.
The market has presented challenges, and we've been evaluating our strategy.
After careful consideration and analysis of multiple scenarios, we've made
some difficult decisions about the structure of our organization going forward.
```

**Good:**
```
Team,

I have difficult news. We're reducing our team by 20% — 30 people.
Affected employees are being notified this morning.
```

**Rule:** First sentence = the news. Second sentence = key detail. Then context.

---

### 5. Acknowledge Difficulty

**Why:** Pretending something isn't hard destroys credibility.

**Bad:** "We're excited about this strategic realignment."

**Good:** "This is incredibly difficult, and I know it affects people's lives."

**Bad:** "This is a normal part of business."

**Good:** "This is not easy news to share, and I understand if you're feeling anxious."

**Rule:** Name the emotion in the room before moving forward.

---

## Tone by Scenario

### Layoff / RIF

**Tone:** Direct, compassionate, honest

**Key phrases:**
- "This is difficult news"
- "Business decision, not performance"
- "We're grateful for their contributions"
- "We're providing [specific severance]"

**Avoid:**
- "Excited," "opportunity," "optimizing"
- "They'll be fine" (you don't know that)
- "This hurts me more than it hurts you"

---

### Security Breach / Crisis

**Tone:** Serious, accountable, action-oriented

**Key phrases:**
- "We take this extremely seriously"
- "Here's what we know"
- "Here's what we're doing"
- "Here's what you need to do"

**Avoid:**
- Minimizing: "It's not a big deal"
- Blaming: "A vendor caused this"
- Defending: "We followed best practices"
- Speculation: "We think maybe..."

---

### Leadership Departure

**Tone:** Professional, respectful, future-focused

**Key phrases:**
- "We're grateful for [specific achievement]"
- "Here's the transition plan"
- "This is what it means for you"
- "We're committed to [continuity/vision]"

**Avoid:**
- Over-the-top praise (sounds fake)
- Vague reasons (creates speculation)
- Focus only on past (address the future)

---

### Policy Change (RTO, Benefits, etc.)

**Tone:** Clear, rationale-based, empathetic

**Key phrases:**
- "Here's what's changing and why"
- "I know this isn't what everyone wants to hear"
- "Here's how it affects you"
- "Reach out if you have concerns"

**Avoid:**
- Defensive posture
- "Everyone else is doing it"
- Ignoring downsides
- "Deal with it" energy

---

### Acquisition / M&A

**Tone:** Optimistic but realistic, clear about changes

**Key phrases:**
- "Here's what's changing"
- "Here's what's staying the same"
- "Here's the timeline"
- "We'll keep you updated"

**Avoid:**
- "Nothing will change" (it always does)
- "This is so exciting!" (feels tone-deaf to anxiety)
- Vague integration promises

## Corporate Speak Translation Table

Replace jargon with plain language:

| Corporate Speak | Plain Language |
|----------------|----------------|
| Right-sizing | Layoffs / reducing headcount |
| Strategic realignment | Changing direction / cutting costs |
| Organizational optimization | Restructuring / eliminating roles |
| Synergies | Cost savings / combined resources |
| Going forward | In the future / from now on |
| Double-click on that | Let's discuss that in detail |
| Circle back | Follow up / revisit |
| Leverage | Use |
| Touch base | Check in / meet |
| Move the needle | Make progress / achieve results |
| Paradigm shift | Major change |
| Low-hanging fruit | Easy wins / quick improvements |
| Drinking from the firehose | Overwhelmed with information |
| Boil the ocean | Attempt something impossibly large |
| Parking lot | Table for later / discuss offline |

**Rule:** If it sounds like a business cliché, replace it with what you'd say to a friend.

## Before/After Examples

### Example 1: Layoff Announcement

**Before (Corporate Speak):**
```
Dear Team,

In order to optimize our operational efficiency and align our organizational
structure with evolving market dynamics, we are executing a strategic workforce
optimization initiative. This difficult but necessary decision will enable us to
better position ourselves for sustainable growth and enhanced shareholder value.

Affected team members will be provided with a competitive separation package
commensurate with their tenure and contributions. We are grateful for the
meaningful impact they have made and wish them success in their future endeavors.
```

**After (Plain Language):**
```
Team,

I have difficult news. We're reducing our team by 15% — 22 people.

Why: Our revenue is growing, but not at the pace we projected. We planned for
40% growth, but we're tracking at 18%. We need to adjust our costs to match reality.

Who's affected: Sales (8 people), Engineering (7), Operations (7).

Support: 12 weeks severance, benefits through December, outplacement services.

These are talented people who made real contributions. This is hard, and I'm sorry.

[CEO Name]
```

**Why it's better:** Direct, specific, honest, human.

---

### Example 2: Security Breach

**Before (Evasive):**
```
We recently became aware of a technical incident that may have affected some
user data. We take the security of our platform seriously and are working
diligently with industry-leading experts to investigate the matter. We will
provide updates as appropriate. Thank you for your continued trust.
```

**After (Direct):**
```
We're writing to inform you of a security breach that affected your account.

What happened: On June 15, hackers gained unauthorized access to our database.

What was accessed: Email addresses, encrypted passwords, and account settings
for approximately 50,000 users (including yours).

What we've done:
- Shut down the compromised system
- Forced password resets for all affected accounts
- Engaged a cybersecurity firm to investigate

What you should do:
1. Reset your password immediately: [link]
2. Enable two-factor authentication
3. Monitor for suspicious activity

We take this extremely seriously and apologize for this incident.

Questions: security@company.com

[Company] Security Team
```

**Why it's better:** Specific, actionable, shows accountability.

---

### Example 3: Return-to-Office Mandate

**Before (Defensive):**
```
After careful analysis of productivity metrics and organizational effectiveness,
we've determined that an in-person collaborative environment optimizes innovation
velocity and cross-functional alignment. Effective Q2, we're implementing a
hybrid model requiring on-site presence 3 days per week. This data-driven
decision reflects best practices across leading organizations.
```

**After (Honest):**
```
Team,

Starting March 1, we're moving to a hybrid model: 3 days in office (Tue/Wed/Thu),
2 days remote.

Why: We've seen collaboration and creativity suffer with fully remote work.
Projects take longer, cross-team communication breaks down, and new hires
struggle to ramp.

I know this isn't what everyone wants to hear. Remote work offers real benefits.
But we believe hybrid is best for our mission and culture.

Timeline:
- Today: Announcement
- +30 days: Policy takes effect
- Before then: Talk to your manager about concerns

Hardship cases: If this creates real difficulty (relocation, caregiving), reach
out to HR. We'll work through individual situations.

I know change is hard. Questions? All-hands Friday at 2 PM.

[CEO]
```

**Why it's better:** Acknowledges the downside, explains reasoning honestly, provides support.

---

### Example 4: CEO Departure (Termination)

**Before (Vague):**
```
The Board of Directors and [CEO Name] have mutually agreed to part ways as the
company embarks on its next phase of growth. We are grateful for [his/her]
service and wish [him/her] well. [Interim CEO] will assume leadership
responsibilities effective immediately as we conduct a search for a permanent
successor.
```

**After (More Direct):**
```
Team,

I'm writing to share an immediate leadership change.

[CEO Name] is no longer with [Company] effective today. This follows a decision
by the board to take the company in a different direction.

Transition:
- [Interim CEO] will serve as interim CEO effective immediately
- We're conducting a search and will update you on timeline

What this means: Your projects and priorities continue. [Interim CEO] is
committed to supporting you through this transition.

I understand this is surprising news. Leadership is available for questions at
office hours Thursday at 3 PM.

[Board Chair]
```

**Why it's better:** Addresses the abruptness, focuses on what's next, offers space for questions.

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Voice: Who You Are (Consistent)

**The company's voice should be:**
- Direct and clear
- Human, not robotic
- Honest, even when it's hard
- Respectful of people's intelligence
- Professional but not stuffy

**Not:**
- Overly casual or flippant
- Corporate jargon-heavy
- Evasive or defensive
- Condescending

---

### Tone: How You Say It (Varies by Context)

**Layoffs:** Compassionate, direct, serious
- "This is incredibly difficult."
- "We're grateful for their work."

**Crisis:** Urgent, accountable, action-oriented
- "We're taking this seriously."
- "Here's what we're doing right now."

**Celebration:** Warm, specific, genuine
- "This is a big deal, and here's why."
- "Thank you for making this happen."

**Policy Change:** Firm but empathetic
- "I know this isn't easy."
- "Here's why we're doing this."

---

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Audience Analysis

**Who's reading this?**
- Affected employees?
- All employees?
- Customers?
- Press?

**What do they care about?**
- How does this affect me?
- What happens next?
- Why is this happening?

**What's their emotional state?**
- Anxious?
- Angry?
- Confused?
- Grieving?

---

### Step 2: Structure

**Every message should answer:**
1. **What happened?** (The news)
2. **Why?** (Context and reasoning)
3. **Who's affected?** (Scope and specifics)
4. **What's next?** (Timeline and action items)
5. **Where to get help?** (Resources and support)

---

### Step 3: Draft

**Write fast, edit slow:**
- First draft: Get it all out, don't self-edit
- Second draft: Cut 30% (remove fluff)
- Third draft: Simplify (replace jargon)
- Fourth draft: Read aloud (does it sound human?)

---

### Step 4: Test

**Before sending, ask:**
- [ ] Is the main news in the first 2 sentences?
- [ ] Can a 10th grader understand this?
- [ ] Have I been specific about numbers, dates, next steps?
- [ ] Does this sound like a human wrote it?
- [ ] Have I acknowledged the difficulty/emotion?
- [ ] Is there any sentence I'm hiding behind? (delete it)
- [ ] Would I want to receive this message?

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Mistake 1: The "Compliment Sandwich" in Terminations

**Bad:**
```
You've done some great work here. Unfortunately, we're eliminating your role.
But you're talented and will land somewhere great!
```

**Why it's bad:** Minimizes the severity. Sounds insincere.

**Fix:**
```
I have difficult news. Due to [business reason], we've made the decision to
eliminate your role. Today is your last day.

This was a business decision, not a reflection of your performance.
```

**Be direct first, then provide context and support.**

---

### Mistake 2: The Vague Explanation

**Bad:** "Due to market conditions and strategic considerations, we're making some organizational changes."

**Why it's bad:** Sounds evasive. Creates speculation.

**Fix:** "Our revenue is $2M below plan, and we need to cut costs by $500K to extend our runway."

**Be specific about the real reason.**

---

### Mistake 3: The "We're So Excited" Energy for Layoffs

**Bad:** "This is a difficult but exciting opportunity to refocus on our core mission!"

**Why it's bad:** Tone-deaf. People are losing jobs.

**Fix:** "This is difficult. We're reducing our team, and that affects real people's lives."

**Acknowledge the hard part, don't spin it.**

---

### Mistake 4: Burying the Lede

**Bad:**
```
As you know, we've been on an incredible journey over the past three years.
We've achieved so much together, and I'm proud of what we've built. However,
the market has shifted, and we need to adapt. After careful consideration...
```

**Why it's bad:** People stop reading. The news is hidden.

**Fix:**
```
I have difficult news. We're reducing our team by 20%.
```

**Lead with the news in sentence one.**

---

### Mistake 5: Overpromising

**Bad:** "This is the last layoff we'll ever do. Everyone's job is safe now."

**Why it's bad:** You don't know that. Destroys trust when you're wrong.

**Fix:** "We don't anticipate further reductions based on our current plan, but we'll continue to monitor the business."

**Be honest about uncertainty.**

- [ ] Active voice (not passive)

**Honesty:**
- [ ] Real reason stated clearly
- [ ] Acknowledges difficulty
- [ ] No spin or sugar-coating
- [ ] Realistic about future

**Completeness:**

**Tone:**
- [ ] Appropriate for situation (serious for layoffs, etc.)

---

## Words to Avoid

**Never use these:**
- Right-sizing
- Optimization
- Synergies
- Strategic realignment
- Organizational efficiency
- Paradigm shift
- Excited (about layoffs, crises)
- Opportunity (when people are losing jobs)
- Unfortunately (overused, sounds insincere)

**Use these instead:**
- Layoffs / reducing headcount
- Changes / restructuring
- Combined resources
- Changing direction
- Eliminating roles
- Major change
- Direct language about the situation
- Challenge / difficult situation
- I'm sorry / This is hard

---

## Final Rule: The Friend Test

**Before sending any message, ask:**

"If I received this message, would I feel:
- Informed (not confused)?
- Respected (not patronized)?
- Clear on what happens next?
- Like a human wrote it (not a PR firm)?"

If the answer to any is "no," rewrite.

Great corporate communication = truth + clarity + humanity.
