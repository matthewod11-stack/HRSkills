### To Full Company (All-Hands + Email)

```
Subject: Important Company Update

Team,

I have difficult news to share.

**What's happening:**

Today we made the hard decision to reduce our team by [X%] - approximately [Y]
people. This affects [departments/functions]. These teammates were notified
this morning.

**Why:**

[Honest explanation - choose one:]
- Revenue: "We're growing, but not at the pace we projected. We planned for [X]%
  growth, but we're tracking at [Y]%."
- Market: "Market conditions have shifted significantly in the past [X] months."
- Strategic: "We're refocusing the company on [new direction], which means we need
  different capabilities."
- Runway: "At our current burn rate, we have [X] months of runway. This extends it
  to [Y] months and gives us time to [reach profitability / raise next round]."

[Be specific and honest - people respect transparency]

**Who's affected:**

[High-level breakdown - NO NAMES:]
- [Engineering]: ~[X] people
- [Sales]: ~[X] people

- [If applicable: Accelerated equity vesting]
- I'm personally committed to making introductions to help them land well

**For those staying - what's next:**

**Priorities:**
[Clear focus areas - be specific]

**Workload:**
We're not expecting the same output with fewer people. We'll be:
- Reducing scope on [specific projects/areas]
- Extending timelines on [specific deliverables]
- Your manager will discuss priorities with your team this week

**Will there be more cuts?**
[Choose based on reality:]
- "This should be the only reduction needed based on our current plan."
- "We don't anticipate further reductions, but we'll continue to monitor the business."
- "I can't make promises about the future, but this addresses our immediate needs."

**How you can help:**

1. **Support your teammates:** Both those leaving and those staying are hurting.
   Be kind to each other.

2. **Ask questions:** Reach out to your manager or HR. Leadership office hours: [times]

3. **Focus forward:** For those staying, let's focus on the work ahead and the
   impact we can make.

### Sudden Departure / Termination

## Template: Return-to-Office Mandate

```
Subject: Office Policy Update - Effective [Date]

Team,

I'm writing to share an important update to our office policy.

**What's changing:**
Effective [date], we're moving to a [hybrid: 3 days/week in office / full return
to office] model.

**Specifically:**
- In-office days: [Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday / all days]
- Flexibility: [Allowed with manager approval / None]
- Remote roles: [Exceptions for fully remote roles hired as remote]

**Why:**
[Honest rationale - choose based on reality:]
- "We've seen collaboration and innovation suffer with fully remote work"
- "Our data shows teams are more productive when together [X] days/week"
- "As a startup, we need the velocity and creativity that comes from in-person"

I know this isn't what everyone wants to hear. Remote work offers real benefits,
and we've appreciated that flexibility. But we believe [in-person / hybrid] is
best for [company success / our culture / our mission].

**Timeline:**
- [Date]: Announcement (today)
- [Date + 30 days]: Policy takes effect
- Between now and then: Work with your manager on any questions

**Exceptions and hardship:**
If you have circumstances that make this difficult (relocation, caregiving, etc.),
please talk to your manager and HR. We'll work through individual situations.

**For those who can't/won't return:**
We understand this may be a dealbreaker for some. If that's you, we'll support
your transition:
- [Details about offboarding, severance if offered, etc.]

**Q&A:**
All-hands on [date] to discuss and answer questions openly.

I know change is hard, especially when it affects work-life balance. We didn't
make this decision lightly.

[Leader]

**FAQ:**

Q: Why now?
A: [Honest answer based on data, culture observations, etc.]

Q: What if I relocated during remote period?
A: Talk to your manager and HR. We'll work through individual situations.

Q: Can I go fully remote?
A: [Exceptions for fully remote hired roles / No, this is company-wide / Case-by-case]

A: Reach out to HR to discuss accommodations or transition options.
