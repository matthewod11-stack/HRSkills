Formats and questions for effective exit interviews.

## Why Exit Interviews Matter

**The data:**
- Only 30% of companies conduct exit interviews systematically
- Companies that analyze exit data have 15% lower turnover
- Exit interviews reveal blind spots that current employees won't share
- Top retention insights come from people leaving, not staying

**What you learn:**
- Why people really leave (not just what they say in resignation)
- Manager effectiveness
- Culture and workplace issues
- Compensation competitiveness
- Growth and development gaps

## What to Do with Exit Interview Data

### Analyze Quarterly

**Look for patterns:**
- Are multiple people leaving for the same reason?
- Is one manager losing all their reports?
- Is compensation mentioned frequently?
- Are high performers leaving faster than low performers?

### Share with Leadership

**Aggregate data:**
- Top 3 reasons for leaving
- Average satisfaction scores by department
- Manager effectiveness scores
- Culture sentiment trends

**Make it actionable:**
- "30% of exits cite lack of growth → implement career development program"
- "Avg manager rating is 6/10 → invest in manager training"
- "Compensation mentioned in 50% of exits → conduct market analysis"

### Take Action

**Examples:**
- Poor manager feedback → coaching or removal
- Compensation issues → market adjustment
- Lack of growth → career path framework
- Culture issues → DEI initiatives, leadership changes

### Close the Loop

- Share insights with managers whose reports left
- Update policies based on feedback
- Communicate changes to current employees ("we heard you")

## Best Practices

1. **Make it safe:** Emphasize confidentiality
2. **Listen more than talk:** 80% listening, 20% talking
3. **Don't get defensive:** Thank them for honesty
4. **Ask follow-ups:** Dig deeper on vague answers
5. **Take notes:** You'll forget details
6. **Act on feedback:** Otherwise it's just theater
7. **Track data:** Use spreadsheet or tool to aggregate
8. **Share learnings:** Help leadership understand patterns

---

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Not conducting exit interviews**
- You're flying blind on why people leave

**Mistake 2: Conducting but not analyzing**
- Data is useless if you don't find patterns

**Mistake 3: Getting defensive**
- Employee shuts down, you lose valuable feedback

**Mistake 4: Not following up on red flags**
- If same manager loses 3 people, investigate

**Mistake 5: Making it feel like interrogation**
- Keep it conversational and safe

---

## Success Metrics

Track:
- Exit interview completion rate (goal: 90%+)
- Primary reasons for leaving (patterns?)
- Average satisfaction scores
- Manager effectiveness scores
- Would recommend rate
- Boomerang hire rate (did they come back?)

Great exit interviews = honest feedback + actionable insights + continuous improvement.
