## Removed Skills (Legacy)

| Skill | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `rippling-integration` | ❌ Deleted | Empty placeholder (0 bytes, no SKILL.md) |
| `interview-hiring` | ❌ Deleted | Empty duplicate of interview-guide-creator |

**Impact:** Zero - these had no SKILL.md files and weren't referenced

---

## Usage Guidelines

### For Claude Instances

**Skill Loading:**
- Skills are auto-detected via keyword matching in `/webapp/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- SKILL.md files are loaded as reference material when workflows trigger
- Reference files provide domain-specific templates and playbooks

**When to Use:**
- Chat system detects workflow → loads relevant skills automatically
- Skills provide detailed prompts + reference materials for domain expertise
- No manual skill selection needed

---

### For Developers

**Adding a New Skill:**

1. Create skill directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p skills/my-skill/references
   ```

2. Create `SKILL.md` with frontmatter:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my-skill
   description: What this skill does
   ---
   # Instructions for Claude
   You are an expert in...
   ```

3. Add detection pattern in `/webapp/app/api/chat/route.ts`:
   ```typescript
   if (/relevant|keywords/.test(messageLower)) {
     return 'my-skill'
   }
   ```

4. Add reference materials in `references/` directory

---

**Modifying Existing Skills:**

1. Edit `SKILL.md` for prompt changes
2. Edit reference files for template/playbook updates
3. Update detection patterns if adding new trigger keywords
4. Test skill detection with sample queries

---

## Best Practices

### Skill Organization

1. **Keep SKILL.md focused** - Core instructions only (< 200 lines)
2. **Move detailed content to reference files** - Templates, examples, frameworks
3. **Use consistent naming** - `{topic}-{type}.md` (e.g., `pip-templates.md`)
4. **Consolidate when appropriate** - Merge related references if >4 files

### Reference File Guidelines

1. **Comprehensive over fragmented** - Prefer 1-2 large files vs 5+ small files
2. **Logical grouping** - Group by workflow phase or related topics
3. **Clear headers** - Use markdown sections for easy navigation
4. **Real examples** - Include actual templates, not just descriptions

### Maintenance

1. **Quarterly review** - Check for outdated content
2. **Usage tracking** - Monitor which skills are most used
3. **Consolidation check** - If skill >5 reference files, consider merging
4. **Version control** - Git commit after major changes

---

## Migration Notes

### From Phase 1 → Phase 2

- 27 individual skills → 8 unified workflows (for routing)
- Individual SKILL.md files preserved as reference libraries
- Consolidated heavy reference libraries (survey, recognition, benefits)
- Removed 2 empty legacy directories

### Architecture

- **Workflows** handle routing (pattern matching)
- **Skills** provide domain expertise (reference material)
- **Hybrid approach** = simplicity + flexibility
