# PIP Legal Compliance & Risk Management

Complete guide to avoiding discrimination, retaliation, and legal pitfalls when implementing PIPs.

---

## Overview: Legal Risks of PIPs

**PIPs are legally risky.**

When done wrong, PIPs become evidence of:
- Discrimination (targeting protected classes)
- Retaliation (punishing protected activity)
- Pretext (fake reason covering illegal motive)
- Failure to accommodate (ADA violations)

**When done right, PIPs protect the company** by showing:
- Fair process
- Clear expectations
- Opportunity to improve
- Documentation of legitimate business reasons

---

## Protected Classes (Federal Law)

### Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

Prohibits discrimination based on:
- **Race**
- **Color**
- **Religion**
- **Sex** (including pregnancy, gender identity, sexual orientation)
- **National origin**

### Additional Federal Protections

- **Age** (40+) - Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)
- **Disability** - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
- **Genetic information** - Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)
- **Military service** - Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)

### State/Local Protections (Varies by Location)

Many states/cities add protections for:
- Marital status
- Sexual orientation (now federal under Title VII, but state laws vary)
- Gender identity/expression
- Political affiliation
- Criminal history
- Caregiver status

**Know your state/local laws.**

---

## Discrimination Red Flags

**Before placing someone on a PIP, ask these questions:**

### Question 1: Is the employee in a protected class?

- Over 40 years old?
- Racial/ethnic minority?
- Female in male-dominated role (or vice versa)?
- Has disclosed disability?
- Pregnant or recently returned from maternity leave?
- Religious minority?

**If YES → Higher scrutiny required. Ensure:**
- Performance issues are documented and objective
- Other employees with similar issues have been treated the same way
- No manager comments about protected characteristic

---

### Question 2: When did performance issues arise?

**RED FLAG if performance issues arose AFTER:**
- Employee reported discrimination/harassment
- Employee took FMLA leave
- Employee requested ADA accommodation
- Employee became pregnant / returned from maternity leave
- Employee hit milestone age (turned 40, 50, 60)
- Employee engaged in protected activity (union organizing, whistleblowing)

**If timing is suspicious:**
- Can you prove performance issues existed BEFORE protected activity?
- Do you have documentation from before?
- Consult employment attorney before proceeding

---

### Question 3: Are you treating this employee differently than others?

**Compare:**
- Have other employees had similar performance issues?
- How were they handled?
- Were they put on PIPs?
- Same standards applied?

**RED FLAG:**
- Employee of Color on PIP for "communication issues" that White employees also exhibit (no PIPs for them)
- Older employee on PIP for "not keeping up with new technology" when younger employees also struggle (no PIPs for them)
- Female employee on PIP for "leadership style issues" (too aggressive) when male employees exhibit same behavior (praised as "assertive")

**If inconsistent treatment:**
- Can you explain why this employee is being treated differently?
- Is the reason legitimate and non-discriminatory?
- Consult HR/legal before proceeding

---

### Question 4: Has the manager made comments about protected characteristics?

**RED FLAG manager comments:**
- "She's been distracted since having the baby" (pregnancy/sex)
- "He's too old to learn this new system" (age)
- "Her accent makes it hard for clients" (national origin)
- "He's been different since his cancer diagnosis" (disability)
- "She's too emotional" (sex stereotype)
- "He needs to be more aggressive" (to Asian employee - racial stereotype)

**If manager has made ANY comments like this:**
- Do NOT proceed with PIP without legal review
- Investigate bias
- Consider removing manager from PIP process
- May need separate performance management for manager

---

## Protected Activities & Retaliation

**Federal law prohibits retaliation for engaging in "protected activity."**

### What is Protected Activity?

**Internal complaints:**
- Reporting discrimination or harassment
- Reporting illegal conduct (fraud, safety violations)
- Reporting wage/hour violations

**External complaints:**
- Filing EEOC charge
- Filing wage claim with Department of Labor
- Filing workers' comp claim
- Testifying in investigation
- Participating in union activity

**Requesting accommodations/leave:**
- Requesting ADA accommodation
- Taking FMLA leave
- Requesting religious accommodation

**Whistleblowing:**
- Reporting illegal activity to government agencies
- Reporting safety violations (OSHA)

---

### Retaliation Red Flags

**Timing is everything.**

**RED FLAG: PIP initiated shortly after protected activity**

Examples:
- Employee reports sexual harassment on 9/15 → Manager puts them on PIP on 9/30 for "poor performance"
- Employee takes 12-week FMLA leave, returns on 10/1 → Manager puts them on PIP on 10/15 for "missed deadlines during leave"
- Employee requests ADA accommodation for depression on 9/1 → Manager denies accommodation and puts employee on PIP on 9/10

**Retaliation doesn't require proof of original claim.**

Example: Employee reports harassment. Investigation finds harassment didn't occur. Manager then puts employee on PIP. **This is still retaliation** even if original harassment claim was unsubstantiated.

---

### How to Avoid Retaliation Claims

**Best practices:**

1. **Delay PIP if timing is suspicious**
   - Wait 3-6 months after protected activity if possible
   - Need to show performance issues are unrelated

2. **Document performance issues from BEFORE protected activity**
   - "Employee missed deadlines in June and July (before FMLA leave in August)"
   - Shows issues pre-existed protected activity

3. **Get legal review before proceeding**
   - Any PIP within 6 months of protected activity = high risk
   - Attorney should review documentation

4. **Ensure manager is not motivated by retaliation**
   - Interview manager: "Why PIP now? Are you upset employee reported harassment?"
   - If manager shows animus, remove from process

---

## ADA: Disability Accommodations & PIPs

**Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to provide "reasonable accommodations" for employees with disabilities.**

**Disability = physical or mental impairment that substantially limits major life activity**

Examples:
- Mobility impairments
- Chronic illnesses (diabetes, cancer, epilepsy)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar)
- Learning disabilities (ADHD, dyslexia)
- Sensory impairments (blind, deaf)

---

### Scenario 1: Employee Requests Accommodation DURING PIP

**Employee on PIP requests accommodation:**
"I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. I need [accommodation] to meet these goals."

**Your obligations:**
1. **Engage in interactive process** (good-faith discussion about accommodation)
2. **Request medical documentation** if disability isn't obvious
3. **Evaluate accommodation request:**
   - Would accommodation enable employee to meet essential job functions?
   - Is it reasonable (doesn't cause undue hardship)?

**Reasonable accommodations examples:**
- Modified work schedule (later start time for medication side effects)
- Work from home days (reduce anxiety from open office)
- Extended deadlines during PIP (more time to adjust to treatment)
- Additional training or mentorship
- Quiet workspace (reduce sensory overload for ADHD)

**Provide accommodation if reasonable, then:**
- Adjust PIP timeline if needed (extend by 30 days to account for accommodation)
- Adjust goals if necessary (but still require essential functions)
- Continue monitoring performance with accommodation in place

---

### Scenario 2: Employee Has Disability, Can't Meet Goals Even with Accommodation

**Employee has disability, you've provided accommodations, but still can't perform essential functions.**

**Can you terminate?**
- **Yes, IF:**
  - Employee cannot perform essential functions even with reasonable accommodation
  - No reasonable accommodation would enable performance
  - Accommodation would cause undue hardship

**Before terminating:**
- [ ] Document interactive process thoroughly
- [ ] Show all accommodations considered
- [ ] Explain why each accommodation was insufficient or caused undue hardship
- [ ] Confirm employee cannot perform essential functions
- [ ] Consult employment attorney

**Key:** Termination must be based on inability to perform essential functions, NOT the disability itself.

---

### Scenario 3: PIP for Attendance Issues + Disability

**Employee has chronic illness, frequent absences, on PIP for attendance.**

**ADA considerations:**
- Additional unpaid leave may be required as accommodation
- But employer doesn't have to excuse absences indefinitely
- Must show regular attendance is essential function
- Must engage in interactive process

**Approach:**
1. Ask: Is employee's attendance issue due to disability? (Request medical documentation)
2. If yes, provide reasonable accommodation (modified schedule, work from home, additional unpaid leave)
3. If accommodation provided and attendance still doesn't improve to acceptable level (after reasonable time), can proceed with termination
4. Document: Regular attendance is essential function, provided X months of accommodation, employee still cannot meet minimum attendance standard

---

## FMLA: Family and Medical Leave & PIPs

**FMLA provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for serious health conditions and family reasons.**

### PIP Timing & FMLA

**RED FLAG: PIP immediately after FMLA leave**

Example: Employee takes 12-week FMLA for surgery, returns on 10/1, placed on PIP on 10/15.

**Problem:** Looks like retaliation for taking FMLA.

**Better approach:**
- If performance issues existed BEFORE FMLA leave, document them thoroughly before leave starts
- If putting employee on PIP after return, show issues existed pre-leave:
  - "Employee missed 8 deadlines in July-August (before FMLA leave in September)"
- Wait 30-60 days after return if possible to establish pattern

---

### PIP During FMLA Leave

**Can you put someone on PIP while they're on FMLA leave?**

**No.**
- FMLA is job-protected
- Employee cannot be expected to work (including PIP goals) while on leave
- Wait until employee returns

**Exception:** Can prepare PIP documents while employee is on leave (if issues existed pre-leave), deliver upon return

---

### FMLA + Reasonable Accommodation

**Scenario:** Employee on PIP requests additional unpaid leave (beyond 12 weeks FMLA) as ADA accommodation.

**Employer obligation:**
- Additional leave beyond FMLA may be required as ADA accommodation
- Typically 30-90 days additional leave is reasonable
- Beyond that, may be undue hardship

**Approach:**
1. Request medical documentation: How much additional leave needed? When can employee return and perform essential functions?
2. Evaluate: Is additional leave reasonable? Will employee be able to perform duties after leave?
3. If granting additional leave, pause PIP clock
4. When employee returns, resume PIP (don't hold leave against them)

---

## Disparate Impact (Unintentional Discrimination)

**Disparate impact = policy that seems neutral but disproportionately affects protected class**

### Example: Age Discrimination

**Scenario:** Company puts 8 employees on PIPs over 6 months.
- 6 out of 8 are over age 50 (75%)
- Company workforce: 30% are over age 50

**Problem:** PIPs disproportionately targeting older workers.

**Even if each individual PIP has legitimate reasons, the pattern suggests age discrimination.**

**How to avoid:**
- Track PIP demographics (age, race, gender)
- Compare to workforce demographics
- Investigate if any protected class is overrepresented
- If pattern exists, investigate root causes:
  - Are managers biased?
  - Are performance standards biased against certain groups?
  - Are certain groups not receiving training/support?

---

### Example: Gender Discrimination

**Scenario:** Female product managers are on PIPs for "communication style" (too aggressive, too emotional) while male PMs with same style are not.

**Problem:** Gender stereotypes = discrimination.

**How to avoid:**
- Define performance standards objectively
- Apply consistently regardless of gender
- Train managers on bias
- Review PIPs for gender patterns

---

## When to Consult Employment Attorney

**Always consult attorney if:**

1. **Employee in protected class + suspicious timing**
   - Employee over 40, minority, disabled, pregnant, etc.
   - PIP within 6 months of protected activity (EEOC charge, FMLA, harassment complaint)

2. **Manager has made discriminatory comments**
   - "Too old" / "Not a cultural fit" / "Can't handle stress because of disability"

3. **Pattern of PIPs targeting protected class**
   - Multiple employees of same race/age/gender on PIPs

4. **High-profile employee or executive**
   - Higher legal risk

5. **Union environment**
   - Collective bargaining agreement may have different process

6. **Employee threatens legal action**
   - "This is discrimination, I'm calling my lawyer"
   - Stop PIP process, involve legal immediately

7. **ADA accommodation complex**
   - Unclear if accommodation is reasonable
   - Employee can't perform essential functions even with accommodation

**Don't DIY high-risk PIPs.** Attorney review costs $1,000-$3,000. Wrongful termination lawsuit costs $50,000-$500,000+.

---

## Reducing Legal Risk: Best Practices

### 1. Document Pre-PIP Coaching

**Before PIP, show:**
- Performance issues were communicated repeatedly
- Employee was given chance to improve
- Informal coaching didn't work

**Creates timeline:**
- June: Coaching conversation #1
- July: Coaching conversation #2
- August: Coaching conversation #3 (no improvement)
- September: Initiate PIP

**Shows:** Not retaliation or sudden decision - longstanding performance issues

---

### 2. Apply Standards Consistently

**Create PIP policy:**
- When do we use PIPs? (What level of performance issues trigger PIP?)
- What's the process? (Coaching first, then PIP)
- How long are PIPs? (30/60/90 days standard?)

**Apply consistently:**
- If you put Employee A on PIP for missing 3 deadlines, you must put Employee B on PIP for missing 3 deadlines
- Inconsistent enforcement = discrimination claim

**Track PIPs:**
- Who's been on PIPs?
- What were the issues?
- What were the outcomes?
- Any demographic patterns?

---

### 3. Write Measurable, Job-Related Goals

**Job-related only:**
- Goals must tie directly to essential functions of job
- Cannot add requirements not in job description

**Example:**
- BAD: "Complete diversity training" (not related to code quality performance issue)
- GOOD: "Achieve 85% first-pass code approval rate" (directly related to engineering job)

**Measurable:**
- Avoid subjective goals ("improve attitude")
- Use objective, measurable criteria

---

### 4. Provide Genuine Support

**PIPs must offer real chance to improve:**
- Training
- Mentorship
- Tools/resources
- Regular check-ins and feedback

**Don't:**
- Create impossible goals
- Provide no support
- Use PIP as formality before pre-decided termination

**Why?** Courts look at whether PIP was genuine opportunity or "sham PIP" (pretext for discriminatory termination)

---

### 5. Document Everything

**Paper trail protects company:**
- Pre-PIP coaching notes
- PIP document with measurable goals
- Weekly check-in notes
- Mid-point review
- Final assessment

**Share documentation with employee:**
- Transparency shows fairness
- Employee can't claim "I didn't know"

---

### 6. HR Should Review Every PIP

**Before delivering PIP:**
- [ ] HR reviews for legal compliance
- [ ] HR checks for discrimination red flags
- [ ] HR verifies consistent application of policy
- [ ] HR confirms measurable goals
- [ ] HR approves language (no discriminatory terms)

**High-risk PIPs → Legal review:**
- Employee in protected class + suspicious timing
- Manager has made biased comments
- Pattern of PIPs targeting protected class

---

## PIP Discrimination Checklist

**Before initiating PIP, verify:**

- [ ] Performance issues are documented (pre-PIP coaching notes exist)
- [ ] Performance issues are specific and measurable (not vague)
- [ ] Performance standards are job-related (tied to essential functions)
- [ ] Standards applied consistently (others with similar issues treated same way)
- [ ] Timing is not suspicious (no recent protected activity)
- [ ] Manager has not made discriminatory comments
- [ ] If employee in protected class, extra scrutiny applied
- [ ] If ADA accommodation needed, interactive process initiated
- [ ] If recent FMLA, performance issues documented pre-leave
- [ ] PIP goals are achievable (not set up to fail)
- [ ] Support and resources will be provided
- [ ] HR has reviewed and approved
- [ ] If high-risk, legal has reviewed

**If any boxes unchecked, do NOT proceed until addressed.**

## Real-World Discrimination Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Age Discrimination

**Facts:**
- Employee is 58 years old
- Manager (age 35) frequently comments: "We need fresh perspectives" and "Younger people adapt faster"
- Manager puts employee on PIP for "not keeping up with new technology"
- Younger employees (ages 28-32) also struggle with new tech, no PIPs

**Legal Risk:** **HIGH** - Age discrimination claim

**Red Flags:**
- Manager's ageist comments
- Employee over 40
- Inconsistent application (younger employees not on PIPs)
- Subjective performance issue ("not keeping up")

**How to fix:**
- Do NOT proceed with PIP
- Investigate manager's bias
- Provide training to all employees (young and old) on new technology
- If employee genuinely underperforming after training, document objectively (failed assessments, missed projects) and apply same standard to younger employees

---

### Scenario 2: Pregnancy Discrimination

**Facts:**
- Employee announces pregnancy on 9/1
- Manager puts employee on PIP on 9/20 for "missing deadlines"
- Employee has no prior documented performance issues
- Manager said to HR: "I'm worried she won't be able to handle the workload with a baby"

**Legal Risk:** **VERY HIGH** - Pregnancy discrimination claim

**Red Flags:**
- Timing (PIP shortly after pregnancy announcement)
- Manager's comment (bias against pregnant women)
- No prior documentation
- Pretextual reason

**How to fix:**
- Do NOT proceed with PIP
- Address manager's bias (training, warning, remove from managing employee)
- If performance issues genuinely exist, document going forward (don't use PIP immediately after pregnancy announcement)
- Wait several months, establish pattern of performance issues unrelated to pregnancy

---

### Scenario 3: Disability Retaliation

**Facts:**
- Employee requests ADA accommodation for ADHD on 10/1 (requests work-from-home 2 days/week)
- Manager denies accommodation, says "We need everyone in office"
- Manager puts employee on PIP on 10/5 for "lack of focus in meetings"
- No prior performance issues documented

**Legal Risk:** **VERY HIGH** - ADA retaliation + failure to accommodate

**Red Flags:**
- Manager denied accommodation without interactive process
- PIP immediately after accommodation request
- "Lack of focus" = disability symptom
- No prior documentation

**How to fix:**
- Do NOT proceed with PIP
- Engage in interactive process (evaluate accommodation request properly)
- If work-from-home is reasonable, provide it
- If "lack of focus" is due to untreated ADHD, accommodation may resolve issue
- Do not punish employee for disability symptoms without first attempting accommodation

---

### Scenario 4: FMLA Retaliation

**Facts:**
- Employee takes 12-week FMLA for surgery (June-August)
- Employee returns September 1
- Manager puts employee on PIP on September 15 for "missed deadlines during Q3"
- Q3 = July, August, September (employee was on leave for 2 of those months)

**Legal Risk:** **VERY HIGH** - FMLA retaliation

**Red Flags:**
- PIP shortly after FMLA return
- Holding employee accountable for deadlines during leave (illegal)
- No documented issues pre-leave

**How to fix:**
- Do NOT proceed with PIP
- Cannot hold FMLA leave against employee
- If genuine performance issues existed BEFORE leave, document those (but wait 30-60 days after return to establish post-return pattern)
- Train manager on FMLA compliance

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Protected classes:** Age 40+, race, sex, disability, pregnancy, religion, national origin (and more depending on state/local laws)

2. **Timing matters:** PIP shortly after protected activity (EEOC charge, FMLA, accommodation request) = retaliation claim

3. **Consistency is key:** Treat all employees with similar performance issues the same way

4. **ADA requires accommodation:** Provide reasonable accommodation before terminating for disability-related performance issues

5. **Document everything:** Paper trail shows legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons

6. **Consult legal when in doubt:** High-risk PIPs should get attorney review

7. **Manager bias is company liability:** Manager's discriminatory comments = company liability, even if company didn't know

**Bottom line:** PIPs are legally risky. Do them right (measurable goals, fair process, consistent application) or risk costly lawsuits. When in doubt, call your employment attorney.

Every PIP should answer: "If this goes to court, can we prove this was based on legitimate performance issues, not discrimination?"

If the answer is no, don't proceed with the PIP.
