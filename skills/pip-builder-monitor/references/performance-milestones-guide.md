# Performance Milestones Guide

Complete guide to writing measurable, achievable performance goals for PIPs.

---

## Why Measurability Matters

**Vague goals = failed PIPs**

If you can't measure it, you can't prove whether the employee met it. Vague goals lead to:
- Disputes about whether improvement occurred
- Discrimination claims ("You said I improved, but still terminated me")
- Legal liability
- Unfair treatment of employees

**Every PIP goal must answer:**
1. **What** needs to improve?
2. **How much** improvement is needed?
3. **How** will we measure it?
4. **By when** must it be achieved?

---

## The SMART Framework

**SMART goals:**
- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-bound

### Specific

**Bad (vague):** "Improve communication"

**Good (specific):** "Respond to all team Slack messages within 4 business hours"

**Why better?** Defines exactly what "improve communication" means.

---

### Measurable

**Bad (not measurable):** "Be more reliable"

**Good (measurable):** "Arrive by 9:00 AM on time 95% of days (maximum 1 late arrival per month)"

**Why better?** Can track via badge swipe / timekeeping system. Clear pass/fail criteria.

---

### Achievable

**Bad (impossible):** "Have zero bugs in your code for 90 days"

**Good (achievable):** "Reduce bug rate from 8% to <3% over 60 days"

**Why better?** Sets realistic improvement (50% reduction) rather than perfection.

---

### Relevant

**Bad (not relevant to job):** "Complete diversity training" (for a performance issue about code quality)

**Good (relevant):** "Pass technical assessment with 80%+ score demonstrating proficiency in [technologies]"

**Why better?** Directly addresses the performance gap.

---

### Time-bound

**Bad (no timeline):** "Improve project management skills"

**Good (time-bound):** "Deliver all assigned projects on time (within estimated completion date) for 8 weeks, or communicate delays 1 week in advance with revised timeline"

**Why better?** Clear timeframe for assessment (8 weeks).

---

## Measurement Methods

### Quantitative Measurements (Preferred)

**Use numbers, percentages, frequencies**

#### Method 1: Percentage / Rate
"Achieve 90% on-time delivery rate (9 out of 10 projects on time)"

#### Method 2: Count / Frequency
"Submit at least 5 code reviews per week"
"Zero client complaints during PIP period"

#### Method 3: Response Time / Duration
"Respond to all client emails within 24 hours, 95% of the time"
"Complete tasks within estimated time +/- 20%"

#### Method 4: Scores / Ratings
"Achieve 80%+ on technical assessment"
"Client satisfaction (CSAT) score of 85%+"

#### Method 5: Volume / Output
"Process minimum 50 support tickets per week"
"Close 10 sales deals per quarter"

---

### Qualitative Measurements (Use Sparingly)

**When quantitative isn't possible, use observable behaviors + third-party validation**

#### Method 1: Third-Party Feedback
"Receive positive feedback from at least 3 team members on collaboration (via survey or written feedback)"

#### Method 2: Manager Observation + Examples
"Demonstrate professional conduct in all team meetings (zero instances of interrupting, dismissing ideas, or raising voice), as observed by manager"

**Important:** Document examples in real-time to avoid bias.

## Goal-Setting by Performance Issue Type

### Issue: Code Quality

**Vague:** "Write better code"

**Measurable:**
- "Achieve 85% first-pass approval rate on code submissions (PRs approved without requiring rework)"
- "Zero critical bugs in production resulting from your code during PIP period"
- "All code passes security scan with zero high-severity vulnerabilities"
- "Code review turnaround time: <48 hours for 90% of reviews"

**Measurement tools:**
- GitHub PR approval data
- Bug tracking system (Jira, Linear)
- Security scan results (Snyk, Checkmarx)
- PR review timestamp data

---

### Issue: Project Management / Deadlines

**Vague:** "Be better at estimating and meeting deadlines"

**Measurable:**
- "Deliver 80% of projects within original estimate (minimum 5 projects)"
- "For projects running over, communicate delays 3+ days before deadline with revised estimate (100% of the time)"
- "Complete estimation training and use estimation template for all projects"

**Measurement tools:**
- Project tracking system (Jira, Asana, Linear)
- Slack/email logs (proactive delay communication)
- Training completion certificate
- Estimation template usage (check project documentation)

---

### Issue: Communication / Responsiveness

**Vague:** "Communicate better with the team"

**Measurable:**
- "Respond to all Slack messages within 4 business hours, 90% of the time"
- "Send weekly status updates every Friday by 5 PM for 12 consecutive weeks"
- "Attend 100% of required team meetings (unless PTO or sick leave)"
- "Zero escalations to manager due to lack of response"

**Measurement tools:**
- Slack analytics (response time data)
- Email/Slack logs (status update delivery)
- Calendar attendance records
- Escalation tracking (manager notes, HR cases)

---

### Issue: Attendance / Punctuality

**Vague:** "Improve attendance"

**Measurable:**
- "Arrive by 9:00 AM on time 95% of days (maximum 1 late day per 30-day period)"
- "Zero unexcused absences during PIP period"
- "If unable to work, notify manager by 7:00 AM (2 hours before shift)"

**Measurement tools:**
- Badge swipe / timekeeping system
- Attendance records
- Communication logs (Slack, text messages with timestamps)

---

### Issue: Customer Service

**Vague:** "Provide better customer service"

**Measurable:**
- "Achieve customer satisfaction (CSAT) score of 85%+ (survey sent at end of PIP)"
- "Respond to 95% of client emails within 24-hour SLA"
- "Zero client escalations to VP during PIP period"
- "Complete 100% of scheduled Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) on time"

**Measurement tools:**
- CSAT survey results (sent to all clients)
- Email tracking system (SLA compliance reports)
- CRM escalation cases (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- QBR completion tracking (calendar + CRM)

---

### Issue: Leadership / Management

**Vague:** "Be a better manager"

**Measurable:**
- "Conduct bi-weekly 1:1s with all 8 direct reports (100% completion rate)"
- "Create individual development plans (IDPs) for all direct reports by Week 8"
- "Team engagement survey score improves by 10+ points (from 45% to 55%+)"
- "Zero resignations during PIP period (not counting resignations submitted before PIP start)"
- "Submit weekly status report every Friday by 5 PM (100% on-time rate)"

**Measurement tools:**
- Calendar 1:1 tracking + meeting notes
- IDP documentation (submitted to HR)
- Employee engagement survey (administered by HR)
- Attrition tracking (HR records)
- Report submission logs

---

### Issue: Interpersonal / Behavioral

**Vague:** "Improve attitude" or "Be more professional"

**This is the hardest to measure. Use observable behaviors.**

**Measurable:**
- "Zero complaints to HR about unprofessional conduct during PIP period"
- "Demonstrate respectful communication in all meetings (no interrupting, dismissing, or raised voice), as observed by manager in weekly team meetings"
- "Receive written feedback from 3+ colleagues stating improvement in collaboration (via anonymous survey)"

**Measurement tools:**
- HR case tracking (complaints)
- Manager observation notes (document real-time in meetings)
- Peer feedback survey (administered by HR at mid-point and end)

**Important:** This is risky. "Attitude" and "professionalism" are subjective and can mask discrimination. Only use behavioral PIPs if:
1. You have documented specific incidents (dates, quotes, witnesses)
2. Manager will observe consistently
3. HR approves (legal review recommended)

---

## Goal-Setting Formula

**Use this template for every goal:**

```
[Action verb] + [Specific outcome] + [Measurement method] + [Target/threshold] + [Timeframe]

Example:
"Respond to [specific outcome] all client emails [measurement method] within 24 hours [target/threshold] 95% of the time [timeframe] during the 60-day PIP period"
```

---

## Common Mistakes & How to Fix

### Mistake 1: Using Only Negative Goals

**Bad:** "Zero bugs" / "Zero complaints" / "Zero missed deadlines"

**Problem:** Focuses only on what NOT to do, not what TO do.

**Fix:** Combine negative goals with positive goals:
- "Zero critical bugs" + "Complete code review checklist before every submission"
- "Zero client complaints" + "Achieve 85% CSAT score"

---

### Mistake 2: Unmeasurable "Soft Skills" Goals

**Bad:** "Be a team player" / "Show initiative" / "Have a positive attitude"

**Problem:** Subjective, hard to measure, discrimination risk.

**Fix:** Define observable behaviors:
- Instead of "Be a team player" → "Attend all team meetings, contribute at least 1 idea per meeting, respond to peer requests within 24 hours"
- Instead of "Show initiative" → "Identify and propose 2 process improvements during PIP period"
- Instead of "Positive attitude" → Avoid this entirely, or use "Zero complaints about conduct, receive positive peer feedback from 3+ colleagues"

---

### Mistake 3: Unrealistic Targets

**Bad:** "Reduce bug rate from 10% to 0% in 30 days" (impossible)

**Problem:** Setting employee up to fail.

**Fix:** Aim for 30-50% improvement over baseline:
- "Reduce bug rate from 10% to 5% over 60 days" (50% reduction, achievable)

---

### Mistake 4: Too Many Goals

**Bad:** PIP with 10 different goals across 5 categories

**Problem:** Employee overwhelmed, can't focus.

**Fix:** 2-4 focused goals maximum. If there are too many issues, prioritize the most critical.

---

### Mistake 5: Goals Not Tied to Role Expectations

**Bad:** For an engineer: "Complete diversity training" (when issue is code quality)

**Problem:** Not relevant to performance gap.

**Fix:** Every goal must directly address the documented performance issue and tie to job requirements.

---

## Testing Your Goals: The "Can We Prove It?" Test

**Before finalizing a PIP, ask:**

1. **If the employee claims they met this goal, can we prove it?**
   - Yes: Good goal (measurable)
   - No: Revise to add measurement

2. **If the employee claims they didn't get a fair chance, can we show what support we provided?**
   - Yes: Good (documented support)
   - No: Add specific support/resources

3. **If this goes to court, can we show this goal was applied consistently to others?**
   - Yes: Good (consistent standard)
   - No: Check if goal is discriminatory or inconsistently applied

4. **Could a reasonable person in this role achieve this goal with effort?**
   - Yes: Good (achievable)
   - No: Goal is unrealistic, revise

## Key Takeaways

1. **Specificity wins:** The more specific your goal, the easier to measure and defend

2. **Use numbers:** Percentages, counts, frequencies, scores make goals measurable

3. **Set achievable targets:** 30-50% improvement from baseline, not perfection

4. **Limit goals:** 2-4 focused goals per PIP, not 10

5. **Tie to role:** Every goal must directly address performance gap and job requirements

6. **Test it:** "Can we prove the employee met (or didn't meet) this goal?" If no, revise.

**Bottom line:** If you can't measure it, you can't manage it. And if you can't manage it, you can't defend termination based on it.

Write goals that are crystal clear, objectively measurable, and directly tied to the job. Protect the employee, protect the company.
