## PERFORMANCE ISSUES

### Issue 1: Code Quality Below Standards

**Current Performance:**
Over the past 3 months, your code submissions have consistently required significant rework due to quality issues:

- 9/15: PR #234 - 15 critical bugs identified in code review, required 3 rounds of revision
- 9/28: PR #267 - Failed unit tests, missing error handling for 6 edge cases

## Template 2: Attendance and Punctuality

**Use for:** Chronic tardiness, unexcused absences, reliability issues

```markdown
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLAN

Employee: [Name]
Title: [Title]
Manager: [Manager Name]
Date: [Date]
Review Period: [Start Date] - [End Date] (30 days)

---

## PURPOSE OF THIS PLAN

This PIP addresses concerns regarding your attendance and punctuality. Reliable attendance is essential for team collaboration and meeting business commitments.

---

## PERFORMANCE ISSUES

### Issue 1: Chronic Tardiness

**Current Performance:**
Over the past 2 months, you have been late to work on 18 out of 40 workdays (45% of the time):

- Week of 9/5: Late Monday (30 min), Tuesday (20 min), Thursday (45 min)
- Week of 9/12: Late Monday (25 min), Wednesday (15 min), Friday (40 min)
- [Continue pattern...]

Your standard work hours are 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM. Being late disrupts team stand-ups (9:15 AM daily) and client meetings.

**Expected Performance:**
Employees are expected to arrive by 9:00 AM (or start time) daily, or communicate in advance if delayed. Acceptable tardiness rate: <5% (maximum 1 day late per month).

---

### Issue 2: Unexcused Absences

**Current Performance:**
You have had 5 unexcused absences in the past 2 months:
- 9/8: Absent, no advance notice, notified manager at 11 AM
- 9/22: Absent, no advance notice, notified manager at 2 PM
- 10/3: Absent, no advance notice, no call/no show (notified next day)
- 10/14: Absent, called out morning of (recurring pattern)
- 10/28: Absent, no advance notice

**Expected Performance:**
If unable to work, employees must notify their manager at least 2 hours before shift start (or as soon as possible in true emergencies). Unexcused absences: 0 tolerance.

---

## IMPROVEMENT GOALS

To successfully complete this PIP, you must achieve the following by [End Date]:

### Goal 1: Punctuality

**Success Criteria:**
- Arrive by 9:00 AM 95% of the time (maximum 1 late arrival during 30-day period)
- If delayed, notify manager via Slack/text by 8:30 AM

**How We'll Measure:**
- Badge swipe logs / timekeeping system
- Slack/text communication logs

---

### Goal 2: Attendance

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero unexcused absences during 30-day period
- If unable to work, notify manager by 7:00 AM (2 hours before start) minimum

**How We'll Measure:**
- Attendance records
- Communication logs (Slack, text, email)

---

## SUPPORT & RESOURCES

**Schedule Flexibility:**
If there are obstacles to arriving by 9 AM (childcare, transportation), let's discuss:
- Potential schedule adjustment (e.g., 9:30 AM start)
- Work-from-home options
- Other accommodations

**Communication:**
- Clear expectations: If delayed, text me by 8:30 AM
- If you're sick, call/text by 7:00 AM

We want to support you, but we need reliability and communication.

---

## CHECK-IN SCHEDULE

- **Weekly 1:1s:** Every Monday at 10 AM (review past week's attendance)
- **Final review:** [Date - Day 30]

---

## OUTCOMES

**Successful Completion:**
If you meet punctuality and attendance goals for 30 days, the PIP will close. Continued reliability will be expected going forward.

**Termination:**
If you have more than 1 late arrival or any unexcused absences during this period, your employment will be terminated.

Note: This is a serious issue. We've had multiple conversations about attendance, and this is your final opportunity to improve.

**Expected Performance:**
Send weekly status updates every Friday by 5 PM. Communicate any requirement changes to affected teams within 24 hours of decision.

---

## Quick Reference: PIP Success Factors

✅ **DO:**
- Use specific, measurable goals
- Include dates and examples
- Provide genuine support
- Document all check-ins
- Be consistent across employees

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use vague language ("improve attitude")
- Make it impossible to succeed (unrealistic goals)
- Skip documentation
- Treat as mere formality before termination
- Apply inconsistently (discrimination risk)

Every PIP should answer: "What specifically needs to improve, how will we measure it, and what support is provided?"

Done right, PIPs clarify expectations and improve performance. Done wrong, they create legal exposure.
