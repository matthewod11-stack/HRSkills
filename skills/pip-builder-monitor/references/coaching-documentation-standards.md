# Coaching & Documentation Standards

Complete guide to documenting PIP check-ins, coaching conversations, and building a defensible paper trail.

---

## Why Documentation Matters

**"If it's not documented, it didn't happen."**

In wrongful termination lawsuits, courts look at the paper trail. Documentation protects:

1. **The Company:** Proves performance issues were addressed, feedback was given, support was provided
2. **The Employee:** Creates transparency, ensures fair treatment
3. **The Manager:** Shows they fulfilled their responsibilities

**Poor documentation = lost lawsuits**

---

## What to Document

### Before the PIP: Pre-PIP Coaching

**Document ongoing feedback conversations BEFORE initiating a PIP.**

**Why?** PIPs should never be the first time an employee hears about performance issues. You need to show:
- Issues were communicated
- Employee was given chance to improve
- Informal coaching didn't work, formal PIP was necessary

**What to document:**
- Date and time of conversation
- Specific performance issue discussed (with examples)
- Feedback provided
- Employee's response
- Agreed-upon next steps
- Follow-up plan

**Template:**
```markdown
**Date:** [Date]
**Attendees:** [Manager, Employee]
**Topic:** Performance Feedback - [Issue]

**Issue Discussed:**
I provided feedback to [Employee] about [specific performance issue]. Specifically:
- [Example 1 with date]
- [Example 2 with date]

**Feedback Provided:**
I explained that [expected performance standard] and that [Employee]'s current performance is [below standard in X way].

**Employee Response:**
[Employee] said [their response - acknowledge issue? Disagree? Provide context?]

**Next Steps:**
- [Action item for employee]
- [Support/resources manager will provide]
- Follow-up: [Date/timeframe for checking progress]

**Next Steps:**
We will check in on [date] to review progress.

---
[Manager Name]
[Date]
```

**Delivery method:**
- Have conversation verbally (in person or video)
- Follow up with email summarizing discussion
- Keep copy in manager's file (not employee's official HR file unless escalated)

---

### During the PIP: Weekly Check-Ins

**Every PIP should have weekly (or bi-weekly) check-ins. Document EVERY check-in.**

**What to document:**
1. **Goal progress:** Specific evidence of progress (or lack thereof) on each goal
2. **Examples:** Real examples from that week (with dates/data)
3. **Feedback provided:** What you told the employee (positive and constructive)
4. **Employee response:** What employee said/committed to
5. **Status assessment:** On track / needs improvement / not meeting expectations
6. **Next week focus:** Priorities for the coming week

**Template:**
```markdown
**PIP CHECK-IN NOTES**

**Employee:** [Name]
**Manager:** [Manager Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**PIP Week:** [Week # of PIP - e.g., Week 3 of 8]

---

## Goal 1: [Goal Description]

**Target:** [Specific measurable target]

**Progress This Week:**
[Factual observations with data/examples]

Example:
- Submitted 4 PRs this week
- PR #456 (10/23): Approved first-pass - excellent work
- PR #457 (10/24): Required 2 rounds of revision - 8 bugs found in initial review
- PR #458 (10/25): Approved first-pass
- PR #459 (10/26): Awaiting review

First-pass approval rate this week: 2 out of 3 completed PRs = 67%

**Cumulative Progress:**
Total PRs during PIP: 12
First-pass approvals: 9 out of 12 = 75% (Target: 85%)

**Status:** ⚠️ Needs improvement (5% below target)

**Feedback Provided:**
I told [Employee]: "You're making progress - 75% is improvement from your baseline of 40%. However, you're still below the 85% target. Let's focus on the types of bugs that are coming up in review. I noticed error handling is a recurring issue. Can you double-check error cases before submitting?"

**Employee Response:**
[Employee] acknowledged the feedback and said they will use the error-handling checklist we created before each PR.

**Next Week Action:**
- [Employee]: Use error-handling checklist for all PRs, focus on edge cases
- [Manager]: Review PR #459 and provide feedback by Friday

---

## Goal 2: [Goal Description]

**Target:** [Target]

**Progress This Week:**
[Evidence]

**Status:** ✅ On track / ⚠️ Needs improvement / ❌ Not meeting expectations

**Feedback Provided:**
[What you told employee]

**Employee Response:**
[What employee said]

**Next Week Action:**
[Priorities]

---

## Overall PIP Status

**Overall Assessment:** [On track for successful completion / Some concerns / Significant concerns]

**Strengths This Week:**
- [Positive observation 1]
- [Positive observation 2]

**Areas for Continued Focus:**
- [Area needing improvement]
- [Area needing improvement]

**Manager's Plan for Next Week:**
- [Support/resources manager will provide]

---

**Next Check-In:** [Date]

**Manager Signature:** ___________ **Date:** ________

---

**Employee Comments (optional):**
[Space for employee to add comments - send to employee after check-in, allow them to respond]
```

**Delivery method:**
1. Conduct check-in verbally (in person or video) - 30-45 minutes
2. Manager writes up notes within 24 hours
3. Email notes to employee: "Attached are my notes from our PIP check-in. Please review and let me know if you have any comments or if I missed anything."
4. Employee can reply with comments/corrections
5. Manager saves final version (with employee comments if any) in PIP file

---

### Mid-Point Review (Formal Assessment)

**At the halfway point of the PIP (e.g., Day 30 of 60-day PIP), conduct formal mid-point review.**

**Purpose:**
- Assess overall progress
- Determine if employee is on track
- Make adjustments if needed (additional support, goal modification)
- Provide clear signal: "You're on track" or "You're not on track - significant improvement needed"

**Template:**
```markdown
**PIP MID-POINT REVIEW**

**Employee:** [Name]
**Manager:** [Manager Name]
**Date:** [Date]
**PIP Period:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Mid-Point Date:** [Halfway date]

---

## Summary of Progress

Over the past [30 days], we have conducted [# of check-ins] weekly check-ins to review your progress on the PIP goals.

---

## Goal 1: [Goal]

**Target:** [Measurable target]

**Progress to Date:**
[Comprehensive summary of progress over entire first half of PIP, with data]

Example:
"You have submitted 15 PRs during the first 30 days of the PIP. Of those:
- 12 were approved first-pass (80% approval rate)
- 3 required rework

Your target is 85% first-pass approval. Current performance: 80% (5 percentage points below target)."

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **Approaching target** - You are making progress but not yet meeting the goal. To successfully complete the PIP, you need to increase your approval rate by 5 percentage points over the next 30 days.

---

## Goal 2: [Goal]

**Target:** [Target]

**Progress to Date:** [Summary]

**Assessment:** ✅ Meeting target / ⚠️ Approaching target / ❌ Not meeting target

---

## Overall Mid-Point Assessment

**Status:** [On track for successful completion / At risk / Not on track]

**Rationale:**
[Explain overall assessment - which goals are being met, which are not, overall trajectory]

Example:
"You are making progress on Goal 1 (code quality) but are still 5% below the target with 30 days remaining. Goal 2 (project deadlines) is being met consistently. Overall, you are **at risk** of not successfully completing the PIP if the current trajectory continues.

To successfully complete this PIP, you need to focus on [specific area] over the next 30 days."

---

## Adjustments to PIP (if any)

[If any goals need adjustment, support needs to change, or timeline needs modification]

Example: "Based on progress, we are adding one additional training session on [topic] in Week 5 to provide additional support."

OR: "No changes to PIP goals or support at this time."

---

## Clear Expectations for Second Half

**To successfully complete this PIP by [End Date], you must:**
1. [Specific requirement 1]
2. [Specific requirement 2]
3. [Specific requirement 3]

**I will provide the following support:**
- [Support item 1]
- [Support item 2]

**If goals are not met by [End Date]:** [Consequence - extension, termination]

---

## Discussion Notes

[Summary of conversation during mid-point review meeting]

Example:
"We discussed the progress on each goal. [Employee] expressed [their perspective]. I provided feedback that [what you said]. We agreed on the next steps outlined above."

---

**Manager Signature:** ___________ **Date:** ________

**Employee Signature:** ___________ **Date:** ________ (Acknowledges receipt and discussion)

**Employee Comments:**
[Space for employee to add comments]
```

---

### Final PIP Assessment

**At the end of the PIP, document the final assessment: Successful, Extension, or Termination.**

See SKILL.md for full templates for each outcome.

**Key components:**
1. Summary of PIP period
2. Final assessment of each goal (Met / Not Met with evidence)
3. Overall conclusion
4. Outcome decision (successful completion, extension, termination)

---

## Documentation Do's and Don'ts

### DO:

✅ **Write factually and objectively**
- "Employee submitted 5 PRs, 3 approved first-pass (60% approval rate)"
- NOT: "Employee's code is terrible"

✅ **Include specific examples with dates**
- "10/23: PR #456 had 8 critical bugs"
- NOT: "Employee's code often has bugs"

✅ **Document in real-time or within 24 hours**
- Write notes immediately after check-in while memory is fresh
- NOT: Wait until end of PIP to write all notes (looks fabricated)

✅ **Include both positive and negative feedback**
- "Employee's code quality improved this week (80% approval vs. 67% last week)"
- Shows fairness, not just building case for termination

✅ **Use data and measurable evidence**
- "Responded to 18 out of 20 Slack messages within 4 hours (90%)"
- NOT: "Employee seems more responsive"

✅ **Document employee's perspective**
- "Employee stated that [their explanation/concern]"
- Shows you listened, considered their view

✅ **Be consistent**
- Use same documentation standard for all employees
- Inconsistent documentation = discrimination risk

---

### DON'T:

❌ **Don't editorialize or use emotional language**
- BAD: "Employee has a bad attitude and is lazy"
- GOOD: "Employee missed 4 deadlines (9/15, 9/22, 10/3, 10/12) despite reminders"

❌ **Don't speculate about motivations**
- BAD: "Employee doesn't care about quality"
- GOOD: "Employee's code had 8 bugs in review; we discussed using code review checklist"

❌ **Don't use discriminatory language**
- Avoid any mention of age, race, gender, disability, religion, pregnancy, etc.
- BAD: "Employee is too old to learn new technologies"
- BAD: "Employee has been distracted since returning from maternity leave"

❌ **Don't backdate documentation**
- If you forgot to document a check-in from 2 weeks ago, note: "Follow-up notes from 10/15 check-in (documented 10/29)"
- Courts can detect backdated documents (inconsistent details, implausible timeline)

❌ **Don't write anything you wouldn't want read in court**
- Assume every document will be read by plaintiff's attorney
- Avoid sarcasm, jokes, or unprofessional language

❌ **Don't skip documentation**
- "We had a great check-in, employee is improving, didn't write notes" → Legally, this check-in didn't happen
- Document EVERY check-in, even if it's positive

---

## Objective vs. Subjective Language

### Objective Language (Use This)

**Observable facts, data, specific examples**

Examples:
- "Employee arrived at 9:20 AM (20 minutes late)"
- "Employee submitted project on 10/15, deadline was 10/10 (5 days late)"
- "Client sent email on 10/5 at 10 AM, employee responded 10/7 at 2 PM (48 hours)"
- "Code review showed 8 critical bugs: SQL injection risk, missing error handling for 3 cases, 2 syntax errors"

---

### Subjective Language (Avoid)

**Opinions, judgments, vague descriptions**

BAD Examples:
- "Employee is lazy"
- "Employee doesn't try hard enough"
- "Employee has a bad attitude"
- "Employee's work is sloppy"

**How to convert subjective to objective:**

| Subjective (BAD) | Objective (GOOD) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Lazy" | "Missed 6 out of 8 deadlines over past 2 months" |
| "Bad attitude" | "Interrupted colleagues 4 times in team meeting, raised voice when feedback provided" |
| "Sloppy work" | "Submitted report with 12 spelling errors, 3 incorrect data points (detailed in attached review)" |
| "Doesn't communicate" | "Did not respond to 15 Slack messages over 3 days, causing project delay" |
| "Unprofessional" | "Arrived 30 minutes late to client meeting without advance notice, client escalated to VP" |

---

## Real-Time Documentation

**Best practice: Document observations as they happen, not at end of PIP.**

**Why?**
- More accurate (details fresh)
- Shows ongoing monitoring (not just building case)
- Harder to claim documentation is fabricated

**How to do real-time documentation:**

**For managers:**
- Keep running note file for each direct report
- After any performance conversation, immediately send follow-up email summarizing discussion (creates timestamp)
- Log check-ins in calendar with brief notes
- Use project management system to track deliverables and deadlines

**Example - Real-time note-taking:**
```
[Manager's private notes - ongoing log]

10/23: Check-in with [Employee] - Reviewed PR #456, approved first-pass, great improvement on error handling. Gave positive feedback.

10/25: [Employee] submitted PR #457 with 8 bugs (error handling still issue). Provided feedback, offered to pair program on next PR.

10/27: [Employee] missed project deadline (due 10/25, notified me today it won't be ready until 10/30). Did not communicate delay in advance. Reminded of expectation to communicate delays 3 days prior.

[At end of week, compile these notes into formal check-in document]
```

---

## Coaching Conversation Framework

**Use this framework for weekly PIP check-ins:**

### 1. Review Progress (10 min)
"Let's review each of your goals. For Goal 1 [code quality], here's what I observed this week..."

[Go through each goal with specific data]

### 2. Ask for Employee's Perspective (5 min)
"How do you feel about your progress? Any challenges you're facing?"

[Listen, document their response]

### 3. Provide Feedback (10 min)
**Positive feedback:**
"Here's what you're doing well..." [Be specific]

**Constructive feedback:**
"Here's where I need to see continued improvement..." [Be specific, tie to goals]

### 4. Offer Support (5 min)
"What support do you need from me this week?"

[Document what you agree to provide]

### 5. Set Next Week's Focus (5 min)
"Here's what I'd like you to prioritize this week..."

[Be specific about 1-2 key priorities]

### 6. Document and Send Notes (5 min)
[Write up notes within 24 hours, email to employee]

---

## Common Documentation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: "Employee Improved" (Too Vague)

**BAD:** "Employee showed improvement this week."

**GOOD:** "Employee's first-pass PR approval rate increased from 67% last week to 80% this week (4 out of 5 PRs approved without rework). This is 5 percentage points below the 85% target, but shows positive trajectory."

---

### Mistake 2: Writing Notes Weeks Later

**BAD:** Writing all PIP check-in notes on Day 59 of 60-day PIP (the day before termination)

**Looks like:** Fabricated evidence to justify pre-determined termination decision

**GOOD:** Writing notes within 24 hours of each check-in, sending to employee weekly

---

### Mistake 3: Only Documenting Negative

**BAD:** Every check-in note is negative: "Employee still not meeting expectations"

**Problem:** Looks like manager decided to terminate on Day 1, PIP was sham

**GOOD:** Document both positive progress and areas needing improvement

Example: "Employee improved on Goal 1 (up to 80% from 67%), but Goal 2 still needs significant work (missed 2 deadlines this week)."

---

### Mistake 4: Vague, Subjective Language

**BAD:** "Employee has a negative attitude and isn't trying hard enough."

**GOOD:** "Employee arrived 30 minutes late to 3 out of 5 team meetings this week (10/21, 10/23, 10/25) without advance notice. When I provided feedback on 10/25, employee said [their response]."

---

### Mistake 5: Not Sharing Notes with Employee

**BAD:** Manager writes PIP check-in notes but never sends to employee

**Problem:** Employee can claim they weren't aware of issues, weren't given feedback

**GOOD:** Email notes to employee after every check-in, allow them to respond with comments

---

## Legal Considerations

**Documentation is the #1 factor in employment lawsuits.**

**Plaintiffs' attorneys look for:**
1. **Lack of documentation:** "If it's not documented, you didn't give feedback"
2. **Inconsistent documentation:** "You documented minor issues for [protected class employee] but not for [non-protected employee]"
3. **Subjective/discriminatory language:** "Your notes say employee is 'too old to learn new tech'" (age discrimination)
4. **Backdated documentation:** "All notes written the day before termination" (fabricated)
5. **Contradictory documentation:** "PIP notes say 'meeting expectations' but terminated anyway" (pretext)

**Best practices:**
- Document consistently for ALL employees (not just those on PIPs)
- Write objectively using facts and data
- Document in real-time
- Share notes with employees
- Keep records for 5+ years after employment ends

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Document everything:** Every check-in, every conversation, every piece of feedback
2. **Write objectively:** Facts, data, examples - not opinions or judgments
3. **Document in real-time:** Within 24 hours, not weeks later
4. **Share with employee:** Transparency protects everyone
5. **Include positive and negative:** Show fairness, not just building case for termination
6. **Use templates:** Consistency across all PIPs
7. **Assume it will be read in court:** Because it might be

**Good documentation protects employees, protects managers, protects the company. Bad documentation loses lawsuits.**

If you're not willing to document it, don't say it. If you did say it, document it.
