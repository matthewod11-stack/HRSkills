1. **When in doubt, ask** - What do you prefer to be called?
2. **Default to inclusive** - Use "they" if you don't know pronouns
3. **Focus on relevant qualifications** - Don't mention protected characteristics unless legally required
4. **Update language regularly** - Inclusive language evolves
5. **Intent ≠ Impact** - Even well-meaning language can cause harm
