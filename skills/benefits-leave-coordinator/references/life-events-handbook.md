# Life Events Handbook

Complete guide to processing benefits changes triggered by qualifying life events.

---

## What is a Qualifying Life Event (QLE)?

**Definition:** A change in life circumstances that makes you eligible to change your benefits elections outside of annual open enrollment.

**Why it matters:**
- Normally, benefits elections are locked in for the year
- QLEs create a 30-day window to make changes
- Missing the deadline = locked in until next open enrollment

**IRS rules:** Most health insurance changes require IRS-qualifying life event (Section 125 cafeteria plan rules)

## 30-Day Rule - Critical Timing

**Universal requirement:** Employee must notify HR and make elections within **30 days** of the qualifying event.

**Start date countdown:**
- Marriage: 30 days from marriage date
- Birth: 30 days from birth date
- Termination: 30 days from termination date
- Loss of coverage: 30 days from date coverage ends (not date you learn about it)

**Examples:**
```
Employee gets married: June 15
Deadline to report: July 15
If employee reports July 20 → Too late, locked out until open enrollment

Employee's spouse loses job: April 10
Spouse's coverage ends: April 30
Deadline to add to employee's plan: May 30
```

**Best practice:** Communicate 30-day rule clearly and immediately when employee reports life event

### Common Questions - Marriage

**Q: We're getting married in 3 months. Can I add my fiancé now?**
A: No. You must wait until after the marriage date. You have 30 days after the marriage to make changes.

**Q: Can I switch from the high-deductible plan to the PPO because I'm getting married?**
A: Yes, marriage allows you to change plans (not just add coverage).

**Q: My spouse has coverage through their employer. Do I have to add them?**
A: No, it's optional. If your spouse has other coverage, they can keep it.

**Q: We got married overseas. Is the marriage certificate valid?**
A: Yes, as long as it's legally valid. You may need to provide translation if not in English.

**Q: We got married last year but I forgot to add my spouse. Can I do it now?**
A: No. You missed the 30-day window. You'll need to wait for open enrollment (unless another QLE occurs).

```
Email to employee (at 32-34 weeks pregnant):

"Congratulations on your upcoming arrival! Let's prepare your benefits and leave:

**Maternity/Parental Leave:**
- FMLA eligibility: [Yes/No - if yes, 12 weeks job-protected]

- You can make changes within 30 days of birth

Questions? Let's set up a benefits review call."
```

**Step 2: After birth notification**
```
Employee emails: "Baby was born on [date]! Name is [name]."

HR response (same day):
"Congratulations! 🎉

Here's what you need to do to add [baby name] to your benefits:

**Deadline:** [Date - 30 days from birth]

**Documents needed:**
1. Birth certificate (hospital letter fine for now, certified copy later)
2. Baby's full name and DOB
3. Baby's SSN (can provide later if not available yet)

**Benefits to update:**

- Vision: Add baby
- Life insurance: Update beneficiaries to include [baby]

**Cost changes:**
- Current health plan: Employee + Spouse = $350/month
- New health plan: Family = $450/month (+$100/month = $50/paycheck)

**Dependent Care FSA:**
- Want to enroll for daycare expenses?
- Max: $5,000/year = $417/month = $192/paycheck
- Tax savings: ~$1,500/year

**Leave:**
- [Confirm FMLA/state leave status and return date]

I've attached enrollment forms. Return by [date].

Want to schedule a call to review everything? [Calendly link]"
```

**Step 3: Process enrollment**

- Update health, dental, vision coverage
- Update beneficiaries

**Step 4: Confirmation**
```
"Your baby has been added to your benefits:

Welcome to the family, [baby name]! 👶"
```

---

### Special Considerations - Adoption

**Timing:** 30 days from placement (date child moves in), not finalization date

**Pre-adoption:** Employee may have significant expenses before finalization
- Adoption assistance programs (if employer offers)
- Adoption FSA (if offered - separate from healthcare FSA, $16,810 max per child in 2024)

**Same-sex couples adopting:**
- Both parents can take parental leave if both work for company
- Check state laws on second-parent adoption

---

### Common Questions - Birth/Adoption

**Q: I had my baby 6 weeks ago and forgot to add them to insurance. Can I still do it?**
A: No, you missed the 30-day window. Exception: Contact your insurance carrier—some carriers allow late adds for newborns with retroactive coverage, even if employer missed deadline. Worth calling.

**Q: My baby needs medical care immediately. Do I have to wait for the insurance card?**
A: No. Coverage is effective from date of birth. Baby can use your member ID for now. Call carrier to confirm coverage.

**Q: Can I drop my spouse and just cover me + baby?**
A: Yes, birth allows you to make any changes to health insurance elections, including dropping coverage for spouse.

**Q: Do I have to add my baby to insurance?**
A: No, if your baby has other coverage (e.g., through spouse's employer). But you should compare plans to see which is better.

**Q: I'm adopting a 15-year-old. Can I add them?**
A: Yes, adopted children are eligible dependents regardless of age (up to age 26).

## Divorce / Legal Separation

### Benefits Impact

**Employee can:**
- Remove ex-spouse from health, dental, vision insurance
- Change health plan tier (from "employee + spouse" to "employee only")
- Update life insurance beneficiaries
- Update 401(k) beneficiaries (unless QDRO requires ex-spouse remain)

**Cannot:**
- Remove ex-spouse immediately if divorce decree requires employee to provide coverage (e.g., until child support ends, alimony obligations met)

**Special case - Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO):**
- If divorce decree requires division of 401(k), ex-spouse may have rights to portion of retirement account
- Requires special QDRO processing (separate from benefits enrollment)

---

### Documentation Required

- Divorce decree (certified copy from court)
- Legal separation agreement (if legal separation vs. divorce)
- QDRO (if applicable - for 401(k) division)

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Initial notification**
```
Employee emails: "I got divorced. I need to remove my ex-spouse from my health insurance."

HR response:
"I'm sorry to hear about your divorce. I can help you update your benefits.

**You have 30 days from the divorce date** to make changes.

**Documents needed:**
- Copy of divorce decree (certified copy from court)

**Changes you can make:**
- Remove ex-spouse from health insurance
- Change beneficiaries (life insurance, 401(k))

**Important:** Check your divorce decree—does it require you to provide health insurance for your ex-spouse? If yes, we may need to keep coverage until [specific date or condition].

**COBRA:** Your ex-spouse will be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage (they pay full premium + 2%). We'll send them COBRA notice.

Please send me the divorce decree and I'll start the process."
```

**Step 2: Review divorce decree**
- Check if court orders continued coverage for ex-spouse
- Check for QDRO language (401(k) division)
- Note date of divorce (start 30-day clock)

**Step 3: Process removal**
- Remove ex-spouse from benefits in HRIS
- Update beneficiaries if requested
- Generate COBRA notice for ex-spouse (required within 14 days of qualifying event)

**Step 4: COBRA notification to ex-spouse**
```
[Sent to ex-spouse at last known address]

"Notice of COBRA Continuation Coverage Rights

Your health insurance coverage through [employee name]'s employer will end on [date] due to divorce.

You have the right to continue your health insurance through COBRA for up to 36 months.

**Your COBRA premium:** $XXX/month (full premium + 2% admin fee)

**Deadline to elect COBRA:** 60 days from [date of this notice or date coverage ends, whichever is later]

To enroll in COBRA, complete the enclosed election form and return by [date]."
```

**Step 5: Confirmation to employee**
```
"Your benefits have been updated:

**Effective Date:** [Date - typically end of month or first of following month]

**Health Insurance:**
- Coverage: Employee only
- Monthly premium: $150/month ($75/paycheck)
- Savings: $200/month

**Beneficiaries Updated:**
- Life insurance: [New beneficiary]

**COBRA notice sent to:** [Ex-spouse name] at [address]

**Next paycheck ([date]) will reflect reduced premiums.**

Questions? [Contact info]"
```

---

### Common Questions - Divorce

**Q: I just filed for divorce. Can I remove my spouse now?**
A: No, not until the divorce is finalized (divorce decree issued). Filing date doesn't trigger QLE.

**Q: My divorce decree says I have to keep my ex on my insurance for 2 more years. Do I have to?**
A: Yes, if court-ordered, you must comply. They'll remain on your plan and you'll pay premiums. After 2 years (or when obligation ends), you can remove them.

**Q: Can my ex-spouse elect COBRA for more than 18 months?**
A: Yes. Divorce is a qualifying event that allows up to **36 months** of COBRA (longer than the typical 18 months for job loss).

**Q: My ex-spouse won't return the insurance ID card. What do I do?**
A: Contact your insurance carrier to deactivate the card and issue you a new one. Coverage ends on the termination date regardless of whether they return the card.

**Q: I'm legally separated, not divorced. Can I remove my spouse?**
A: Yes, if your state recognizes legal separation as a qualifying event and you have a legal separation agreement.

## Death of Dependent or Spouse

### Benefits Impact

**Death of spouse:**
- Remove spouse from health, dental, vision
- May trigger COBRA for spouse's dependents (if employee was covering stepchildren)
- Update beneficiaries

**Death of child:**
- Remove child from health, dental, vision
- Employee may need bereavement leave
- May need counseling resources (EAP)

---

### Documentation Required

- Death certificate (certified copy)
- May accept obituary initially, death certificate later

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Compassionate initial response**
```
Employee emails: "My [spouse/child] passed away on [date]."

HR response (same day, empathetic tone):
"I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Please know that [company name] is here to support you during this incredibly difficult time.

**Take the time you need.** Please don't worry about benefits or paperwork right now. We can handle all of this when you're ready.

**Bereavement leave:** You have [X days] of paid bereavement leave. Take whatever time you need—we can discuss an extension if needed.

**Support resources:**
- Employee Assistance Program (EAP): [Phone number] - Free confidential counseling
- [Other resources - grief support groups, etc.]

When you're ready—no rush—we'll help you with benefits updates. For now, just take care of yourself and your family.

I'm here if you need anything at all.

With deepest sympathy,
[HR name]"
```

**Step 2: Follow-up (1-2 weeks later)**
```
"Checking in to see how you're doing. No rush, but when you're ready, here's what we'll need to update your benefits:

**Documents:** Copy of death certificate (we can accept obituary for now)

**Benefits to update:**
- Remove [name] from health insurance
- Update life insurance beneficiaries (if needed)
- [If spouse died] Life insurance claim - [Spouse] had $[amount] coverage through company

Again, handle this when you're ready. No deadline pressure.

Here if you need anything."
```

**Step 3: Process removal (when employee provides documentation)**
- Remove dependent from benefits system
- Generate final premium adjustment
- Update beneficiaries if requested
- If spouse died and had life insurance through employer → initiate life insurance claim

**Step 4: Benefits confirmation + life insurance claim (if applicable)**
```
"I've updated your benefits:

**Health Insurance:**
- [Name] removed as of [date]
- Your coverage: [Employee only / Employee + Children]
- Premium: $XXX/month (reduced by $XX)

**Life Insurance:**
[If spouse died and had coverage]
[Spouse] had life insurance coverage of $[amount] through [company]. I've started the claim process with [insurance carrier].

You should receive:
- Claim packet from [carrier] within 7-10 days
- Instructions for submitting claim
- Estimated processing time: 4-6 weeks

**Support resources available:**
- EAP: [Contact info]
- Bereavement support: [Resources]

I'm here if you need anything or have questions about this process."
```

---

### Special Considerations - Death

**Sensitivity:** This is the most difficult life event. Prioritize compassion over process.

**Timing:** While there's technically a 30-day rule for benefits changes, be flexible. No one should be penalized for grieving.

**Life insurance claims:** If deceased was employee, spouse/beneficiary will need to file claim. If deceased was spouse, employee may need to file on behalf of spouse's coverage.

**Tax implications:** Life insurance proceeds are generally tax-free, but consult tax advisor for specific situations.

---

## Loss of Other Coverage

### Benefits Impact

**Common scenarios:**
- Spouse loses job → Employee can add spouse to their plan
- Parent turns 26, loses coverage under parent's plan → Employee can get own plan
- Divorce → Loss of coverage under ex-spouse's plan → Employee can get own plan or COBRA

**Special enrollment right:** Federal law (HIPAA) requires that employee can enroll within 30 days of losing other coverage, even if they previously declined coverage.

---

### Documentation Required

**Proof of loss of coverage:**
- Letter from prior insurance carrier
- COBRA notice
- Termination notice from employer
- Medicare letter (if aging into Medicare)

**Must show:**
- Date coverage ended
- Reason for loss (involuntary loss, not voluntary drop)

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Verification**
```
Employee emails: "My spouse lost their job and their health insurance ends on [date]. Can I add them to mine?"

HR response:
"Yes! Loss of other coverage is a qualifying life event. You can add your spouse to your plan.

**Timeline:** You have 30 days from the date coverage ends to enroll.

**What I need:**
- Proof of loss of coverage (letter from spouse's former employer or insurance carrier)
- Spouse's SSN and DOB
- Completed enrollment form

**Coverage start date:** [Typically first of month following enrollment or loss date, per plan rules - check your plan]

**Cost:**
- Current: Employee only = $150/month
- With spouse: Employee + Spouse = $350/month
- Increase: $200/month ($100/paycheck)

Let's get your spouse covered. Send me the documents and I'll process immediately."
```

**Step 2: Process enrollment**
- Verify proof of involuntary loss (job loss, divorce, aging out - NOT voluntary drop)
- Add spouse in benefits system
- Update payroll

**Step 3: Confirmation**
```
"Your spouse has been added to your health insurance:

**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Coverage:** Employee + Spouse
**Premium:** $350/month ($175/paycheck)
**New ID cards:** Arriving in 7-10 days

Your spouse's coverage gap: [If any gap between old coverage end and new coverage start, note it - may want to look into COBRA for gap period]

Questions? [Contact]"
```

---

### Common Questions - Loss of Coverage

**Q: My spouse voluntarily quit their job. Can I still add them?**
A: Yes. Voluntary termination still qualifies as loss of coverage.

**Q: My spouse was offered COBRA but it's too expensive. Can I add them to my plan instead?**
A: Yes. Being offered COBRA doesn't negate the loss of coverage QLE.

**Q: My spouse's coverage doesn't end for another 30 days. Can I add them now?**
A: You can start the process now, but coverage typically doesn't start until the old coverage ends. Time the enrollment so it's within 30 days of coverage end date.

**Q: I declined coverage during open enrollment because I had coverage through my spouse. Now my spouse lost their job. Can I enroll?**
A: Yes! This is exactly what the special enrollment period is for. You have 30 days from loss of coverage.

---

## Dependent Turning Age 26

### What Happens

**Federal law (ACA):** Dependents can stay on parent's plan until age 26.

**Coverage ends:** Last day of the month they turn 26 (or birthday, depending on state/plan)

**Example:**
```
Dependent turns 26 on June 15
Coverage ends: June 30 (in most states)
```

---

### Notifications

**Proactive HR approach - 60 days before 26th birthday:**

```
Email to employee:

"Heads up: Your dependent [name] will turn 26 on [date].

Under federal law, they'll lose eligibility for coverage under your plan on [end date].

**Your dependent's options:**

1. **Enroll in employer plan** (if employed and eligible)
   - They should contact their employer's HR

2. **Purchase individual plan** (HealthCare.gov)
   - Open enrollment: Nov 1 - Jan 15
   - Special enrollment: 60 days from loss of coverage

3. **COBRA** (continue your plan for 36 months)
   - Cost: $XXX/month (they pay full premium + 2%)
   - Must elect within 60 days

We'll send them a COBRA notice automatically.

**Your cost savings:** $XX/month starting [date]

Questions? Let me know."
```

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: System notification (HR identifies dependents turning 26 in next 60 days)**

**Step 2: Notify employee and dependent (60 days before)**

**Step 3: Terminate coverage (last day of month they turn 26)**

**Step 4: Send COBRA notice to dependent**

**Step 5: Update employee's payroll (reduce premium)**

## 30-Day Deadline Enforcement

**What if employee misses 30-day deadline?**

**Strict rule:** IRS requires 30-day limit for Section 125 cafeteria plans. Missing deadline = locked out until open enrollment.

**Exceptions (rare):**
1. Insurance carrier may allow late add for newborns (call to confirm)
2. HIPAA special enrollment for loss of coverage may extend beyond 30 days in some cases
3. Employer may have grace period (check plan documents)

**Best practice:**
- Communicate 30-day rule clearly and repeatedly
- Send reminders at 15 days, 7 days, 1 day before deadline
- Document all communications
- If employee misses deadline, explain (kindly but firmly) that it's an IRS rule, not a company policy
