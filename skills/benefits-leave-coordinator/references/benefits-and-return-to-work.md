## Decision Support Tools

### Health Plan Comparison Matrix

**Include for all plans:**
- Monthly premium (employee cost)
- Annual deductible (individual & family)
- Out-of-pocket maximum
- Primary care copay
- Specialist copay
- ER visit cost
- Prescription drug costs (generic, brand, specialty)
- Network (PPO, HMO, EPO)

### Cost Calculator Template

**Inputs:**
1. How often do you visit the doctor? [0, 1-2, 3-5, 6+ times/year]
2. Do you take medications regularly? [Yes/No → How many?]
3. Do you see specialists? [Yes/No]
4. Expecting surgery or major procedure? [Yes/No]
5. Do you have chronic conditions? [Yes/No]
6. Coverage tier? [Employee only, +spouse, +children, family]

**Output:**
| Plan | Premium | Est. Medical Costs | Total Annual Cost | **Recommendation** |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PPO | $1,800 | $2,500 | **$4,300** | ⭐ Best for your needs |
| HMO | $1,200 | $3,200 | $4,400 | Good option |
| HDHP | $600 | $5,800 | $6,400 | Higher out-of-pocket |

### HSA vs FSA Decision Tree

**Question 1:** Are you enrolled in a high-deductible health plan?
- **No** → You can only do FSA (not HSA)
- **Yes** → Continue to Q2

**Question 2:** Do you have predictable medical expenses this year?
- **Yes (e.g., planned surgery, regular prescriptions)** → Consider FSA (use it or lose it, but great for known costs)
- **No** → Consider HSA (rolls over, saves for future)

**Question 3:** Can you afford to fund it?
- **HSA contribution limits:** $4,150 individual / $8,300 family (2024)
- **FSA contribution limits:** $3,200 (2024)

**Recommendation:**
- Healthy + want to save long-term = **HSA**
- Know you'll spend it this year = **FSA**

**Vendors to invite:**
- Health insurance carrier

**Agenda:**
- Vendor booths (employees visit at will)

## Employee Q&A: Top 20 Questions

### About Enrollment Process

**Q1: What happens if I don't enroll?**
A: [Passive enrollment - you keep current elections with new rates / Active enrollment required - you lose coverage]

**Q2: Can I change my elections mid-year?**
A: Generally no, unless you have a qualifying life event (marriage, birth, divorce, loss of coverage). Changes must be made within 30 days of the event.

**Q3: When does my new coverage start?**
A: January 1, 2025 (typically first day of new plan year).

**Q4: I made a mistake. Can I change it?**
A: Yes, if you notify us within [5 business days] of enrollment closing. After that, locked in until next open enrollment.

---

### About Health Plans

**Q5: What's the difference between PPO, HMO, and HDHP?**
A:
- **PPO:** Flexibility to see any provider, no referrals needed, higher premiums
- **HMO:** Lower premiums, must choose primary care doctor, need referrals for specialists, network restrictions
- **HDHP:** Lowest premiums, high deductible, pairs with HSA for tax savings

**Q6: Can I keep my current doctor?**
A: Check the provider directory for your chosen plan. Networks may change year-to-year.

**Q7: What's a deductible vs. out-of-pocket maximum?**
A:
- **Deductible:** Amount you pay before insurance starts paying (except preventive care)
- **Out-of-pocket max:** Most you'll pay in a year (after this, insurance pays 100%)

---

### About HSA/FSA

**Q8: What can I use my HSA/FSA for?**
A: Qualified medical expenses: doctor visits, prescriptions, dental, vision, medical equipment. See IRS Publication 502 for full list.

**Q10: What happens to my FSA money if I don't use it?**
A: Use-it-or-lose-it (with grace period or carryover if company offers). HSA rolls over indefinitely.

---

### About Costs

A: Yes! You have 30 days from the marriage date to notify HR and add your spouse. Requires marriage certificate.

**Q16: I'm having a baby. What do I do?**
A: Notify HR within 30 days of birth to add baby to your coverage. Also check maternity/paternity leave policies.

---

### About Leaving Company

**Q17: What happens to my benefits if I leave?**
A:
- Health insurance: COBRA continuation available (you pay full cost)
- HSA: It's yours forever
- FSA: Use-it-or-lose-it by end of plan year (some grace period)
- Life insurance: Ends, may be able to convert to individual policy

**Q18: What is COBRA and how much does it cost?**
A: COBRA lets you keep your health insurance for 18 months after leaving. Cost: Full premium + 2% admin fee (typically $600-$2,000/month depending on plan and coverage tier).

---

### About Wellness

---

## Overview: Return-to-Work Process

**Goal:** Successfully transition employee back to work while:

- Ensuring medical clearance
- Providing reasonable accommodations if needed
- Supporting employee and manager

**Key laws:**

- **Workers' Comp:** State-specific requirements for modified duty

---

## Types of Returns

### 1. Full Return (No Restrictions)
- Employee cleared to return to full duties
- No accommodations needed
- Fitness-for-duty certification confirms ability to perform all essential functions

### 2. Return with Temporary Restrictions
- Time-limited restrictions (e.g., "No lifting >20 lbs for 4 weeks")
- Restrictions expected to resolve
- May need temporary accommodations

### 3. Return with Permanent Restrictions
- Ongoing restrictions (e.g., "Permanent lifting restriction 25 lbs")
- May need permanent accommodations
- ADA interactive process required

### 4. Phased Return (Gradual)
- Gradually increasing hours/duties over time
- Common for mental health conditions, major surgeries
- Example: Week 1-2 (20 hrs), Week 3-4 (30 hrs), Week 5+ (40 hrs)

### 5. Modified Duty (Alternative Work)
- Cannot perform essential functions of current role
- Temporarily assigned to different role
- Common in workers' comp cases

---

## Fitness-for-Duty Certifications

### When to Require

**FMLA leave:** Employer can require fitness-for-duty certification for employee's own serious health condition

**Allowed if:**
- Employer requires for all employees returning from similar leave
- Limited to essential functions of job
- Policy clearly states fitness-for-duty required

**Not allowed:**
- Cannot require for family leave (caring for family member)
- Cannot require genetic information
- Cannot ask for diagnosis or medical records

---

### What to Request

**Fitness-for-duty form should ask:**
- Can employee perform essential functions of the job? (Yes/No)
- Are there any restrictions? (If yes, describe)
- Duration of restrictions (Temporary or permanent)
- Recommended accommodations (if any)

**Example form:**
```
RETURN-TO-WORK MEDICAL CLEARANCE

Employee: [Name]
Position: [Job title]
Returning from: Medical leave for [general reason - e.g., "surgery"]

To Healthcare Provider:

This employee is returning to work on [date]. Please review the attached job description (essential functions) and complete:

1. Is the employee able to return to work? [ ] Yes [ ] No

2. Can the employee perform all essential functions of the job?
   [ ] Yes, without restrictions
   [ ] Yes, with restrictions (describe below)
   [ ] No

3. If restrictions, please describe:
   _________________________________

4. Are restrictions:
   [ ] Temporary (expected end date: _______)
   [ ] Permanent

5. Recommended accommodations (if any):
   _________________________________

6. Follow-up evaluation needed? [ ] Yes (date: _____) [ ] No

Healthcare Provider Signature: ________________
Date: ___________
```

**Key:** Attach job description with essential functions so provider knows what job requires

---

### Timing

**Request certification:**
- Include in FMLA designation notice (at beginning of leave)
- Or notify employee at least 15 days before return date

**Employee deadline:**
- Give reasonable time to obtain (typically 5-7 business days)

**What if employee doesn't provide?**
- Can delay return until provided
- Cannot terminate for failure to provide if employee is making good faith effort

---

## ADA Interactive Process

### When Required

**Trigger ADA interactive process if:**
- Employee has restrictions (temporary or permanent)
- Employee requests accommodation
- Employee cannot perform essential functions even after FMLA

**ADA basics:**
- Employee must have a "disability" (physical/mental impairment that substantially limits major life activity)
- Employer must provide "reasonable accommodation" unless it causes "undue hardship"
- Process is interactive (back-and-forth discussion)

---

### Step-by-Step Interactive Process

#### Step 1: Receive Medical Information
- Employee provides fitness-for-duty form or medical documentation
- Note restrictions and recommended accommodations

#### Step 2: Initiate Interactive Process
```
Email to employee:

"Thank you for providing medical clearance. I see your doctor has recommended [restrictions/accommodations].

To ensure we support your successful return to work, I'd like to schedule a call to discuss:
- Your medical restrictions
- Possible accommodations
- How we can modify your job duties or workspace to support you

This is called the 'interactive process' and is required under the ADA. It's a collaborative discussion to find solutions that work for both you and the company.

When are you available for a call? [Scheduling link]

In the meantime, I'll review your job description and brainstorm potential accommodations.

Looking forward to having you back!"
```

#### Step 3: Interactive Meeting
**Participants:** Employee, HR, Manager (optional), Employee's representative (optional)

**Discussion points:**
- Review essential functions of job
- Review medical restrictions
- Brainstorm possible accommodations
- Discuss what would enable employee to perform job

**Questions to ask:**
- What specific limitations do you have?
- How do these limitations affect your job duties?
- What accommodations would help you perform your job?
- Are there other positions that would better suit your restrictions?

**Document everything:** Take notes, send follow-up summary email

#### Step 4: Evaluate Accommodations
**Consider:**
- **Effectiveness:** Will it enable employee to perform essential functions?
- **Reasonableness:** Is it feasible and doesn't cause undue hardship?
- **Employee preference:** Employee's preferred accommodation should be given primary consideration

**Common accommodations:**
- Modified work schedule (later start, work from home)
- Ergonomic equipment (standing desk, special chair, monitor arms)
- Reassignment to vacant position
- Job restructuring (remove non-essential functions)
- Modified equipment (voice-to-text software, screen reader)
- Leave as accommodation (additional unpaid leave beyond FMLA)

**Undue hardship factors:**
- Significant difficulty or expense
- Impact on operations
- Size and resources of employer

#### Step 5: Offer Accommodation
```
Email to employee (after interactive meeting):

"Thank you for meeting with me to discuss accommodations. Based on our discussion, here's what we're proposing:

**Accommodations:**
1. [Accommodation 1 - e.g., "Standing desk and ergonomic chair in your workspace"]
2. [Accommodation 2 - e.g., "Modified schedule: 9:30am start (instead of 8:30am) for 4 weeks"]
3. [Accommodation 3 - e.g., "Work from home 2 days/week for 6 weeks"]

**Duration:** [Temporary - through [date] OR Permanent]

**Implementation:** We'll have [accommodation 1] set up by [date]. Your modified schedule starts [date].

**Re-evaluation:** We'll check in [every 2 weeks / in 30 days] to see how accommodations are working.

Do these accommodations address your needs? If you have any concerns or need adjustments, let me know. We want to make sure this works for you.

Looking forward to your return on [date]!

[HR Name]"
```

#### Step 6: Implement and Monitor
- Set up accommodations before return date
- Check in regularly (weekly for first month, then monthly)
- Document effectiveness
- Be flexible—accommodations may need adjustment

---

### ADA Documentation

**Keep separate file (medical information = confidential):**
- Medical documentation and restrictions
- Interactive process notes
- Accommodation requests and decisions
- Follow-up evaluations

**Retention:** Keep for duration of employment + 1 year after termination

---

## Phased Return-to-Work Plans

### What is a Phased Return?

**Definition:** Gradual increase in hours or duties over time

**Common for:**
- Major surgeries (cardiac, orthopedic)
- Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, burnout)
- Chronic illnesses (cancer treatment, autoimmune disorders)

**Example:**
```
Week 1-2: 20 hours/week (4 hours/day, 5 days)
Week 3-4: 30 hours/week (6 hours/day, 5 days)
Week 5-6: 40 hours/week (full-time)

Duties: Focus on [low-stress tasks] for first 2 weeks, gradually add [client meetings, project management] as stamina increases
```

---

### Creating a Phased Return Plan

**Step 1: Medical Recommendation**
- Healthcare provider recommends phased return
- Specifies gradual increase (hours/duties)
- Estimates timeline

**Step 2: HR + Manager + Employee Discussion**
- What duties can employee handle initially?
- What's a realistic schedule progression?
- How will we cover work during reduced hours?
- What's the expected end date for full return?

**Step 3: Document Plan**
```
PHASED RETURN-TO-WORK PLAN

Employee: [Name]
Position: [Title]
Manager: [Manager name]
Return date: [Date]

**Phase 1: Week 1-2 (Starting [date])**
- Hours: 20 hours/week (Monday-Friday, 10am-2pm)
- Duties: [Specific tasks - e.g., "Email correspondence, documentation, internal meetings only"]
- Restrictions: No travel, no client-facing work

**Phase 2: Week 3-4 (Starting [date])**
- Hours: 30 hours/week (Monday-Friday, 9am-3pm)
- Duties: Add [e.g., "Team meetings, project planning"]
- Restrictions: No travel

**Phase 3: Week 5+ (Starting [date])**
- Hours: 40 hours/week (Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm)
- Duties: Full duties resumed
- Restrictions: None

**Check-ins:**
- End of Week 2: HR + Manager + Employee
- End of Week 4: HR + Manager + Employee
- Evaluate progress and adjust plan as needed

**Compensation:**
- Weeks 1-2: Paid for 20 hours + [PTO to supplement OR unpaid for remaining hours]
- Weeks 3-4: Paid for 30 hours + [PTO to supplement OR unpaid]
- Week 5+: Full-time salary

Employee acknowledgment: _____________ Date: ______
Manager acknowledgment: _____________ Date: ______
HR acknowledgment: _____________ Date: ______
```

**Step 4: Monitor and Adjust**
- Weekly check-ins during phased return
- Adjust if employee struggling or progressing faster than expected
- Document all changes

---

### Phased Return and Pay

**Exempt employees (salaried):**
- Cannot dock pay for partial week worked
- Options:
  - Use PTO to supplement reduced hours (employee gets full paycheck)
  - Employee takes unpaid leave (FMLA) for hours not worked (if FMLA available)
  - Short-term disability may pay for reduced hours (check policy)

**Non-exempt employees (hourly):**
- Pay for hours worked
- Can use PTO to supplement
- May use short-term disability for hours not worked

---

## Workers' Compensation Returns

### Workers' Comp Basics

**Workers' comp leave = different from FMLA:**
- FMLA: Restoration to same or equivalent position
- Workers' comp: May require accepting modified duty (varies by state)

**State laws vary:** Check your state's workers' comp laws for specific requirements

---

### Modified Duty

**What is modified duty?**
- Temporarily assigning employee to different work within their restrictions
- Goal: Keep employee working while they heal

**Example:**
```
Warehouse worker (usual job: loading trucks, lifting 50+ lbs)
Injury: Back strain, restriction: No lifting >10 lbs for 6 weeks

Modified duty: Assigned to inventory scanning (sedentary work)
Duration: 6 weeks or until cleared for full duty
```

**Employer obligations (state-specific):**
- Many states require employers offer modified duty if available
- Cannot force employee to accept modified duty that worsens condition
- Must pay workers' comp wage replacement if no modified duty available

---

### Return-to-Work Process for Workers' Comp

**Step 1: Receive medical release**
- Employee's treating physician provides work status
- Lists restrictions and capabilities

**Step 2: Evaluate modified duty options**
- Can employee return to regular job with restrictions?
- If not, is there modified duty available?

**Step 3: Offer modified duty (if available)**
```
Email to employee:

"Your doctor has cleared you to return to work with restrictions: [list restrictions].

We've identified a modified duty assignment within your restrictions:

**Modified Position:** [Title/duties]
**Responsibilities:** [Brief description]
**Schedule:** [Hours]
**Pay:** [Same as regular rate OR workers' comp wage replacement if less, depending on state law]
**Duration:** Until you're cleared for full duty or [end date]

This is a temporary assignment to support your recovery while keeping you working. Once you're cleared for full duty by your doctor, you'll return to your regular position.

Are you able to start on [date]? Please confirm and we'll get everything set up.

[HR Name]"
```

**Step 4: Monitor and communicate**
- Weekly check-ins with employee and manager
- Stay in contact with workers' comp adjuster
- Get updated medical releases as recovery progresses

**Step 5: Return to regular duty**
- When physician clears for full duty, return to regular position
- Confirm with fitness-for-duty certification

---

### Refusing Modified Duty

**Consequences (state-specific):**
- Some states allow termination of workers' comp benefits if employee refuses reasonable modified duty
- Must show modified duty is within restrictions and doesn't worsen condition
- Consult state workers' comp laws and employment attorney

---

## Communication During Leave

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- Check in periodically (every 2-3 weeks) for benefits and return planning
- Keep employee informed of organizational changes that affect them
- Provide timeline for return-to-work planning
- Send "thinking of you" messages (empathetic, brief)

**DON'T:**
- Discuss work assignments or projects
- Expect employee to respond to work emails
- Pressure employee to return early
- Call daily or weekly (feels intrusive during medical recovery)

**Example check-in email (Week 4 of 12-week FMLA):**
```
Subject: Checking In - No Response Required

Hi [Employee],

Just wanted to check in and see how you're doing. No work talk, just making sure you have everything you need.

**Benefits:** Your health insurance and all benefits remain active. Nothing for you to do.

**Return planning:** When your leave is getting closer to the end (around Week 10), I'll reach out to start planning your return. Until then, focus on your recovery.

**Questions?** If you have any benefits questions or need anything from me, reply anytime. Otherwise, no response needed.

## Manager Preparation for Employee Return

### What Managers Need to Know

**Before employee returns, HR should brief manager:**

**1. Return date and schedule**
- When is employee returning?
- Full-time or phased return?
- Any modified schedule?

**2. Medical restrictions (only what manager needs to know)**
- What are the restrictions?
- What accommodations have been set up?
- What duties can/cannot employee perform?

**Important:** Share only job-related restrictions, not diagnosis or medical details

**3. Work assignment plan**
- What projects should employee be assigned?
- What should be avoided (high-stress, tight deadlines) during transition?
- Who's been covering employee's work and how to transition back?

**4. Confidentiality and anti-retaliation**
- Employee's medical information is confidential
- Cannot treat employee differently because of leave
- Cannot retaliate for taking FMLA leave
- If employee has restrictions, don't gossip or speculate about medical condition

**5. Check-in plan**
- Manager should schedule 1:1 for first day back
- Weekly check-ins for first month
- Open-door policy for concerns

### Manager Script for Employee's First Day Back

```
"Welcome back! We've missed you. How are you feeling?"

[Let employee respond - don't pry into medical details]

"I want to make sure your transition back goes smoothly. Here's what I'm thinking:

**Your first week:**
- I've kept your schedule light - focus on [low-key tasks]
- Let's have a 1:1 on Friday to see how things are going
- If you need anything or have concerns, my door is always open

**Work you missed:**
- [Brief update on major projects/changes]
- [Team member] has been covering [specific tasks] - they'll brief you

**Accommodations:**
- [Mention accommodations if any - e.g., 'I see you have a new standing desk' or 'Your modified schedule is 9:30am start for the next few weeks']

**Take your time:**
- Don't feel like you need to jump back in at 100% on day one
- Ease back in and let me know if it's too much or too little

Questions or concerns? Let's talk."
```

## Common Return-to-Work Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Employee Returns, Immediately Struggles

**Situation:** Employee returned from 12-week FMLA for back surgery, says they're "fine." After 3 days, clearly struggling - grimacing, moving slowly, leaving early.

**Manager action:**
1. Check in with employee privately: "I've noticed you seem to be having some difficulty. Are you okay? Do you need adjustments?"
2. If employee admits struggling, notify HR
3. HR initiates interactive process for accommodations

**HR action:**
```
Email to employee:

"Your manager mentioned you're experiencing some difficulty since returning. We want to support you.

Let's discuss possible accommodations that could help:
- Modified schedule
- Work-from-home options
- Ergonomic adjustments
- Additional recovery time

Would you like to schedule a call? Also, if your medical condition has changed, please get an updated release from your doctor.

We're here to help you succeed."
```

### Scenario 2: Employee Requests Extension of Leave Beyond FMLA

**Situation:** Employee on 12-week FMLA for depression. At end of 12 weeks, requests additional 4 weeks unpaid leave.

**Analysis:**
- FMLA exhausted (12 weeks used)
- Additional leave may be required as ADA accommodation (if disability)
- Or employer can grant as company policy (not legally required)

**HR action:**
1. Request updated medical documentation: Can employee return to work with accommodations? If not, how much additional leave needed?
2. Evaluate: Is additional leave reasonable accommodation? Would it cause undue hardship?
3. Consult employment attorney if unsure

**If granting additional leave:**
```
Email to employee:

"Thank you for your request for additional leave. We've reviewed your updated medical documentation.

We're approving an additional 4 weeks of unpaid leave as an accommodation under the ADA.

**Leave extension:** Through [date]
**Return date:** [Date]
**Job status:** Your position will be held for you
**Benefits:** Health insurance continues; you'll pay your portion

Before you return, please obtain medical clearance from your healthcare provider confirming you can return to work.

We're here to support you. Check in with me if anything changes.

Take care,
[HR Name]"
```

### Scenario 3: Employee Cannot Return Even with Accommodations

**Situation:** Employee on leave for permanent disability, cannot perform essential functions even with accommodations, no other positions available.

**Analysis:**
- FMLA exhausted
- ADA requires reasonable accommodation, but if employee cannot perform essential functions with accommodations, termination may be lawful
- **Critical:** Document interactive process thoroughly, show good faith effort to accommodate

**HR action (consult employment attorney first):**
1. Document interactive process:
   - Medical restrictions
   - Essential functions of job
   - Accommodations considered and why they don't work
   - Whether other positions available (answer: no)
2. Send termination letter (with legal review):

```
[Legal-reviewed termination letter]

Dear [Employee],

We have worked with you over the past [timeframe] to identify accommodations that would enable you to return to your position as [title].

Based on your medical restrictions and our interactive process, we have concluded that:
- You are unable to perform the essential functions of your position even with reasonable accommodations
- There are no other vacant positions available that match your restrictions
- Additional leave beyond [X months] would cause undue hardship to operations

Therefore, we must separate your employment effective [date].

**Final pay:** [Details]
**Benefits:** Health insurance through [date]; COBRA information enclosed
**Unemployment:** You may be eligible; contact [state unemployment office]

We appreciate your [X years] of service and wish you the best in your recovery.

Sincerely,
[HR Director]
```

## Red Flags and Legal Pitfalls

### Red Flag: Treating Employee Differently After Return

**Example of retaliation:**
- Employee takes 12-week FMLA for surgery
- Returns to work
- Manager assigns less desirable projects, excludes from meetings, gives negative performance review
- This = FMLA retaliation (illegal)

**How to avoid:**
- Treat employee exactly as they were treated before leave
- Same duties, same opportunities, same performance standards
- Document that treatment is consistent

### Red Flag: Terminating Shortly After Return

**Scenario:** Employee returns from FMLA, terminated 2 weeks later for "performance issues"

**Legal risk:** Strong inference of retaliation, even if performance issues are real

**How to mitigate:**
- If performance issues existed before leave, document thoroughly
- If performance issues arise after return, give employee time to ramp back up
- If termination necessary, consult employment attorney, document extensively

### Red Flag: Denying Accommodations Without Interactive Process

**Scenario:** Employee requests work-from-home as accommodation, manager immediately denies without discussion

**Problem:** ADA requires interactive process (good-faith discussion)

**How to avoid:**
- Always engage in interactive process
- Document why accommodation would cause undue hardship (if denying)
- Propose alternative accommodations

## Key Takeaways

1. **Medical clearance:** Always require fitness-for-duty certification for employee's own serious health condition
2. **ADA interactive process:** Required when employee has restrictions or requests accommodations
3. **Phased returns:** Document the plan, monitor closely, adjust as needed
4. **Communication:** Balance staying in touch with respecting employee's recovery time
5. **Manager prep:** Brief managers on restrictions and accommodations, emphasize confidentiality
6. **Anti-retaliation:** Treat employee the same before and after leave
7. **Document everything:** Protect employee and company with thorough documentation

Great return-to-work planning = welcoming employees back safely, providing needed support, staying compliant, and setting everyone up for success.
