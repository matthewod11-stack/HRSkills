# Life Events Handbook

Complete guide to processing benefits changes triggered by qualifying life events.

---

## What is a Qualifying Life Event (QLE)?

**Definition:** A change in life circumstances that makes you eligible to change your benefits elections outside of annual open enrollment.

**Why it matters:**
- Normally, benefits elections are locked in for the year
- QLEs create a 30-day window to make changes
- Missing the deadline = locked in until next open enrollment

**IRS rules:** Most health insurance changes require IRS-qualifying life event (Section 125 cafeteria plan rules)

## 30-Day Rule - Critical Timing

**Universal requirement:** Employee must notify HR and make elections within **30 days** of the qualifying event.

**Start date countdown:**
- Marriage: 30 days from marriage date
- Birth: 30 days from birth date
- Termination: 30 days from termination date
- Loss of coverage: 30 days from date coverage ends (not date you learn about it)

**Examples:**
```
Employee gets married: June 15
Deadline to report: July 15
If employee reports July 20 → Too late, locked out until open enrollment

Employee's spouse loses job: April 10
Spouse's coverage ends: April 30
Deadline to add to employee's plan: May 30
```

**Best practice:** Communicate 30-day rule clearly and immediately when employee reports life event

### Common Questions - Marriage

**Q: We're getting married in 3 months. Can I add my fiancé now?**
A: No. You must wait until after the marriage date. You have 30 days after the marriage to make changes.

**Q: Can I switch from the high-deductible plan to the PPO because I'm getting married?**
A: Yes, marriage allows you to change plans (not just add coverage).

**Q: My spouse has coverage through their employer. Do I have to add them?**
A: No, it's optional. If your spouse has other coverage, they can keep it.

**Q: We got married overseas. Is the marriage certificate valid?**
A: Yes, as long as it's legally valid. You may need to provide translation if not in English.

**Q: We got married last year but I forgot to add my spouse. Can I do it now?**
A: No. You missed the 30-day window. You'll need to wait for open enrollment (unless another QLE occurs).

```
Email to employee (at 32-34 weeks pregnant):

"Congratulations on your upcoming arrival! Let's prepare your benefits and leave:

**Maternity/Parental Leave:**
- FMLA eligibility: [Yes/No - if yes, 12 weeks job-protected]

Questions? Let's set up a benefits review call."
```

**Step 2: After birth notification**
```
Employee emails: "Baby was born on [date]! Name is [name]."

HR response (same day):
"Congratulations! 🎉

Here's what you need to do to add [baby name] to your benefits:

**Deadline:** [Date - 30 days from birth]

**Documents needed:**
1. Birth certificate (hospital letter fine for now, certified copy later)
2. Baby's full name and DOB
3. Baby's SSN (can provide later if not available yet)

**Benefits to update:**

- Life insurance: Update beneficiaries to include [baby]

**Cost changes:**

- New health plan: Family = $450/month (+$100/month = $50/paycheck)

**Dependent Care FSA:**
- Want to enroll for daycare expenses?
- Max: $5,000/year = $417/month = $192/paycheck
- Tax savings: ~$1,500/year

**Leave:**
- [Confirm FMLA/state leave status and return date]

I've attached enrollment forms. Return by [date].

Want to schedule a call to review everything? [Calendly link]"
```

**Step 3: Process enrollment**

- Update health, dental, vision coverage

```

Welcome to the family, [baby name]! 👶"
```

---

### Special Considerations - Adoption

**Timing:** 30 days from placement (date child moves in), not finalization date

**Pre-adoption:** Employee may have significant expenses before finalization
- Adoption assistance programs (if employer offers)
- Adoption FSA (if offered - separate from healthcare FSA, $16,810 max per child in 2024)

**Same-sex couples adopting:**
- Both parents can take parental leave if both work for company
- Check state laws on second-parent adoption

---

### Common Questions - Birth/Adoption

**Q: I had my baby 6 weeks ago and forgot to add them to insurance. Can I still do it?**
A: No, you missed the 30-day window. Exception: Contact your insurance carrier—some carriers allow late adds for newborns with retroactive coverage, even if employer missed deadline. Worth calling.

**Q: My baby needs medical care immediately. Do I have to wait for the insurance card?**
A: No. Coverage is effective from date of birth. Baby can use your member ID for now. Call carrier to confirm coverage.

**Q: Can I drop my spouse and just cover me + baby?**
A: Yes, birth allows you to make any changes to health insurance elections, including dropping coverage for spouse.

**Q: Do I have to add my baby to insurance?**
A: No, if your baby has other coverage (e.g., through spouse's employer). But you should compare plans to see which is better.

**Q: I'm adopting a 15-year-old. Can I add them?**
A: Yes, adopted children are eligible dependents regardless of age (up to age 26).

## Divorce / Legal Separation

### Benefits Impact

**Employee can:**
- Remove ex-spouse from health, dental, vision insurance
- Change health plan tier (from "employee + spouse" to "employee only")
- Update life insurance beneficiaries
- Update 401(k) beneficiaries (unless QDRO requires ex-spouse remain)

**Cannot:**
- Remove ex-spouse immediately if divorce decree requires employee to provide coverage (e.g., until child support ends, alimony obligations met)

**Special case - Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO):**
- If divorce decree requires division of 401(k), ex-spouse may have rights to portion of retirement account
- Requires special QDRO processing (separate from benefits enrollment)

---

### Documentation Required

- Divorce decree (certified copy from court)
- Legal separation agreement (if legal separation vs. divorce)
- QDRO (if applicable - for 401(k) division)

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Initial notification**
```
Employee emails: "I got divorced. I need to remove my ex-spouse from my health insurance."

HR response:
"I'm sorry to hear about your divorce. I can help you update your benefits.

**You have 30 days from the divorce date** to make changes.

**Documents needed:**
- Copy of divorce decree (certified copy from court)

**Changes you can make:**
- Remove ex-spouse from health insurance
- Change beneficiaries (life insurance, 401(k))

**Important:** Check your divorce decree—does it require you to provide health insurance for your ex-spouse? If yes, we may need to keep coverage until [specific date or condition].

**COBRA:** Your ex-spouse will be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage (they pay full premium + 2%). We'll send them COBRA notice.

Please send me the divorce decree and I'll start the process."
```

**Step 2: Review divorce decree**
- Check if court orders continued coverage for ex-spouse
- Check for QDRO language (401(k) division)
- Note date of divorce (start 30-day clock)

**Step 3: Process removal**
- Remove ex-spouse from benefits in HRIS
- Update beneficiaries if requested
- Generate COBRA notice for ex-spouse (required within 14 days of qualifying event)

**Step 4: COBRA notification to ex-spouse**
```
[Sent to ex-spouse at last known address]

"Notice of COBRA Continuation Coverage Rights

Your health insurance coverage through [employee name]'s employer will end on [date] due to divorce.

You have the right to continue your health insurance through COBRA for up to 36 months.

**Your COBRA premium:** $XXX/month (full premium + 2% admin fee)

**Deadline to elect COBRA:** 60 days from [date of this notice or date coverage ends, whichever is later]

To enroll in COBRA, complete the enclosed election form and return by [date]."
```

**Step 5: Confirmation to employee**
```
"Your benefits have been updated:

**Effective Date:** [Date - typically end of month or first of following month]

**Health Insurance:**
- Coverage: Employee only
- Monthly premium: $150/month ($75/paycheck)
- Savings: $200/month

**Beneficiaries Updated:**
- Life insurance: [New beneficiary]
- 401(k): [New beneficiary or "Not updated - let me know if you'd like to change"]

**COBRA notice sent to:** [Ex-spouse name] at [address]

**Next paycheck ([date]) will reflect reduced premiums.**

Questions? [Contact info]"
```

---

### Common Questions - Divorce

**Q: I just filed for divorce. Can I remove my spouse now?**
A: No, not until the divorce is finalized (divorce decree issued). Filing date doesn't trigger QLE.

**Q: My divorce decree says I have to keep my ex on my insurance for 2 more years. Do I have to?**
A: Yes, if court-ordered, you must comply. They'll remain on your plan and you'll pay premiums. After 2 years (or when obligation ends), you can remove them.

**Q: Can my ex-spouse elect COBRA for more than 18 months?**
A: Yes. Divorce is a qualifying event that allows up to **36 months** of COBRA (longer than the typical 18 months for job loss).

**Q: My ex-spouse won't return the insurance ID card. What do I do?**
A: Contact your insurance carrier to deactivate the card and issue you a new one. Coverage ends on the termination date regardless of whether they return the card.

**Q: I'm legally separated, not divorced. Can I remove my spouse?**
A: Yes, if your state recognizes legal separation as a qualifying event and you have a legal separation agreement.

## Death of Dependent or Spouse

### Benefits Impact

**Death of spouse:**
- Remove spouse from health, dental, vision
- May trigger COBRA for spouse's dependents (if employee was covering stepchildren)
- Update beneficiaries

**Death of child:**
- Remove child from health, dental, vision
- Employee may need bereavement leave
- May need counseling resources (EAP)

---

### Documentation Required

- Death certificate (certified copy)
- May accept obituary initially, death certificate later

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Compassionate initial response**
```
Employee emails: "My [spouse/child] passed away on [date]."

HR response (same day, empathetic tone):
"I am so deeply sorry for your loss. Please know that [company name] is here to support you during this incredibly difficult time.

**Take the time you need.** Please don't worry about benefits or paperwork right now. We can handle all of this when you're ready.

**Bereavement leave:** You have [X days] of paid bereavement leave. Take whatever time you need—we can discuss an extension if needed.

**Support resources:**
- Employee Assistance Program (EAP): [Phone number] - Free confidential counseling
- [Other resources - grief support groups, etc.]

When you're ready—no rush—we'll help you with benefits updates. For now, just take care of yourself and your family.

I'm here if you need anything at all.

With deepest sympathy,
[HR name]"
```

**Step 2: Follow-up (1-2 weeks later)**
```
"Checking in to see how you're doing. No rush, but when you're ready, here's what we'll need to update your benefits:

**Documents:** Copy of death certificate (we can accept obituary for now)

**Benefits to update:**
- Remove [name] from health insurance
- Update life insurance beneficiaries (if needed)
- [If spouse died] Life insurance claim - [Spouse] had $[amount] coverage through company

Again, handle this when you're ready. No deadline pressure.

Here if you need anything."
```

**Step 3: Process removal (when employee provides documentation)**
- Remove dependent from benefits system
- Generate final premium adjustment
- Update beneficiaries if requested
- If spouse died and had life insurance through employer → initiate life insurance claim

**Step 4: Benefits confirmation + life insurance claim (if applicable)**
```
"I've updated your benefits:

**Health Insurance:**
- [Name] removed as of [date]
- Your coverage: [Employee only / Employee + Children]
- Premium: $XXX/month (reduced by $XX)

**Life Insurance:**
[If spouse died and had coverage]
[Spouse] had life insurance coverage of $[amount] through [company]. I've started the claim process with [insurance carrier].

You should receive:
- Claim packet from [carrier] within 7-10 days
- Instructions for submitting claim
- Estimated processing time: 4-6 weeks

**Support resources available:**
- EAP: [Contact info]
- Bereavement support: [Resources]

I'm here if you need anything or have questions about this process."
```

---

### Special Considerations - Death

**Sensitivity:** This is the most difficult life event. Prioritize compassion over process.

**Timing:** While there's technically a 30-day rule for benefits changes, be flexible. No one should be penalized for grieving.

**Life insurance claims:** If deceased was employee, spouse/beneficiary will need to file claim. If deceased was spouse, employee may need to file on behalf of spouse's coverage.

**Tax implications:** Life insurance proceeds are generally tax-free, but consult tax advisor for specific situations.

---

## Loss of Other Coverage

### Benefits Impact

**Common scenarios:**
- Spouse loses job → Employee can add spouse to their plan
- Parent turns 26, loses coverage under parent's plan → Employee can get own plan
- Divorce → Loss of coverage under ex-spouse's plan → Employee can get own plan or COBRA

**Special enrollment right:** Federal law (HIPAA) requires that employee can enroll within 30 days of losing other coverage, even if they previously declined coverage.

---

### Documentation Required

**Proof of loss of coverage:**
- Letter from prior insurance carrier
- COBRA notice
- Termination notice from employer
- Medicare letter (if aging into Medicare)

**Must show:**
- Date coverage ended
- Reason for loss (involuntary loss, not voluntary drop)

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: Verification**
```
Employee emails: "My spouse lost their job and their health insurance ends on [date]. Can I add them to mine?"

HR response:
"Yes! Loss of other coverage is a qualifying life event. You can add your spouse to your plan.

**Timeline:** You have 30 days from the date coverage ends to enroll.

**What I need:**
- Proof of loss of coverage (letter from spouse's former employer or insurance carrier)
- Spouse's SSN and DOB
- Completed enrollment form

**Coverage start date:** [Typically first of month following enrollment or loss date, per plan rules - check your plan]

**Cost:**
- Current: Employee only = $150/month
- With spouse: Employee + Spouse = $350/month
- Increase: $200/month ($100/paycheck)

Let's get your spouse covered. Send me the documents and I'll process immediately."
```

**Step 2: Process enrollment**
- Verify proof of involuntary loss (job loss, divorce, aging out - NOT voluntary drop)
- Add spouse in benefits system
- Update payroll

**Step 3: Confirmation**
```
"Your spouse has been added to your health insurance:

**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Coverage:** Employee + Spouse
**Premium:** $350/month ($175/paycheck)
**New ID cards:** Arriving in 7-10 days

Your spouse's coverage gap: [If any gap between old coverage end and new coverage start, note it - may want to look into COBRA for gap period]

Questions? [Contact]"
```

---

### Common Questions - Loss of Coverage

**Q: My spouse voluntarily quit their job. Can I still add them?**
A: Yes. Voluntary termination still qualifies as loss of coverage.

**Q: My spouse was offered COBRA but it's too expensive. Can I add them to my plan instead?**
A: Yes. Being offered COBRA doesn't negate the loss of coverage QLE.

**Q: My spouse's coverage doesn't end for another 30 days. Can I add them now?**
A: You can start the process now, but coverage typically doesn't start until the old coverage ends. Time the enrollment so it's within 30 days of coverage end date.

**Q: I declined coverage during open enrollment because I had coverage through my spouse. Now my spouse lost their job. Can I enroll?**
A: Yes! This is exactly what the special enrollment period is for. You have 30 days from loss of coverage.

---

## Dependent Turning Age 26

### What Happens

**Federal law (ACA):** Dependents can stay on parent's plan until age 26.

**Coverage ends:** Last day of the month they turn 26 (or birthday, depending on state/plan)

**Example:**
```
Dependent turns 26 on June 15
Coverage ends: June 30 (in most states)
```

---

### Notifications

**Proactive HR approach - 60 days before 26th birthday:**

```
Email to employee:

"Heads up: Your dependent [name] will turn 26 on [date].

Under federal law, they'll lose eligibility for coverage under your plan on [end date].

**Your dependent's options:**

1. **Enroll in employer plan** (if employed and eligible)
   - They should contact their employer's HR

2. **Purchase individual plan** (HealthCare.gov)
   - Open enrollment: Nov 1 - Jan 15
   - Special enrollment: 60 days from loss of coverage

3. **COBRA** (continue your plan for 36 months)
   - Cost: $XXX/month (they pay full premium + 2%)
   - Must elect within 60 days

We'll send them a COBRA notice automatically.

**Your cost savings:** $XX/month starting [date]

Questions? Let me know."
```

---

### Processing Steps

**Step 1: System notification (HR identifies dependents turning 26 in next 60 days)**

**Step 2: Notify employee and dependent (60 days before)**

**Step 3: Terminate coverage (last day of month they turn 26)**

**Step 4: Send COBRA notice to dependent**

**Step 5: Update employee's payroll (reduce premium)**

## 30-Day Deadline Enforcement

**What if employee misses 30-day deadline?**

**Strict rule:** IRS requires 30-day limit for Section 125 cafeteria plans. Missing deadline = locked out until open enrollment.

**Exceptions (rare):**
1. Insurance carrier may allow late add for newborns (call to confirm)
2. HIPAA special enrollment for loss of coverage may extend beyond 30 days in some cases
3. Employer may have grace period (check plan documents)

**Best practice:**
- Communicate 30-day rule clearly and repeatedly
- Send reminders at 15 days, 7 days, 1 day before deadline
- Document all communications
- If employee misses deadline, explain (kindly but firmly) that it's an IRS rule, not a company policy

#### 2. Employee Tenure - 12 Months
**Requirement:** Employed for at least 12 months (doesn't need to be consecutive)

**Common scenarios:**
- Employee worked 8 months, left, returned 6 months later → Eligible (14 total months)
- Employee on unpaid leave for 3 months → Leave time counts toward 12-month requirement
- Acquired company → Prior employment counts if there was no break in service

**Calculation:**
```
Hire date: [Date]
Gaps in employment: [Any breaks in service?]
Total tenure: [X months]
Eligible? [Yes/No]
```

#### 3. Hours Worked - 1,250 in Last 12 Months
**Requirement:** Worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months immediately before leave starts

**What counts:**
- All hours worked (regular, overtime, training)
- Paid leave (vacation, sick, holidays)
- Does NOT count: Unpaid leave, breaks

**Calculation:**
```
1,250 hours = approximately 24 hours/week for 52 weeks

Look back period: [Leave start date] back 12 months to [date]
Hours worked: [X hours]
Eligible? [Yes/No]
```

**Common scenarios:**
- Part-time employee (20 hrs/week) → 1,040 hours/year → NOT eligible
- Part-time employee (25 hrs/week) → 1,300 hours/year → Eligible
- Employee increased hours 6 months ago → May now be eligible, recalculate

#### 4. Worksite - 50 Employees Within 75 Miles
**Requirement:** Works at location where employer has 50+ employees within 75-mile radius

**How to calculate:**
- Measure straight-line distance ("as the crow flies"), not driving distance
- Include all employees within radius (not just at employee's specific office)
- Include employees on leave, part-time, temporary

**Example:**
```
Employee worksite: Seattle office (30 employees)
Other locations within 75 miles:
- Bellevue office: 25 employees (10 miles away)
- Tacoma office: 20 employees (32 miles away)
Total within 75 miles: 75 employees → Eligible

Employee worksite: Remote worker in rural Montana
Nearest office: 120 miles away → NOT eligible
```

### FMLA Leave Reasons - Deep Dive

#### Reason 1: Serious Health Condition (Employee or Family Member)

**Definition of "serious health condition":**

**YES - Qualifies:**
- Overnight hospitalization
- Incapacity for 3+ consecutive days + 2+ doctor visits or 1 visit + continuing treatment
- Chronic conditions requiring periodic treatment (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, migraines)
- Pregnancy complications (morning sickness that requires treatment)
- Prenatal care
- Substance abuse treatment (inpatient or supervised by healthcare provider)

**NO - Does not qualify:**
- Common cold, flu (unless complications)
- Routine dental/orthodontic appointments
- Cosmetic procedures (unless complications)
- Voluntary cosmetic treatments

**Medical certification required:**
- DOL Form WH-380-E (employee's condition) or WH-380-F (family member)
- Healthcare provider must complete
- Due within 15 calendar days of request

#### Reason 2: Birth/Bonding with Newborn

**Eligible parents:**
- Birth mother (also eligible for her own serious health condition)
- Father
- Domestic partner (if state recognizes)

**Timeframe:** Must be taken within 12 months of birth

**Can be taken:**
- All at once (12 weeks)
- Intermittently (e.g., 1 day per week for 12 weeks = 12 days)
- If employer approves intermittent bonding leave

**Spouses working for same employer:**
- Limited to combined 12 weeks for birth/bonding
- Each parent gets own 12 weeks for serious health condition

#### Reason 3: Adoption or Foster Care Placement

**Same rules as birth:**
- 12 weeks within 1 year of placement
- Both parents eligible (combined 12 weeks if same employer)

**Covers:**
- Pre-placement meetings
- Required counseling
- Court proceedings

#### Reason 4: Military Family Leave

**Qualifying exigency leave (12 weeks):**
- Family member called to active duty (National Guard/Reserves)
- Covers: Legal/financial arrangements, counseling, childcare, attending military events

**Military caregiver leave (26 weeks in single 12-month period):**
- Caring for covered service member (current or veteran) with serious injury/illness
- Veteran must have been discharged within 5 years

---

### FMLA Leave Types

#### Continuous Leave
**Definition:** Employee off work continuously for days/weeks

**Example:**
- Surgery with 6-week recovery
- Maternity leave (6 weeks postpartum)

**Administration:**
- Track as single block of time
- Employee must provide notice (30 days if foreseeable, ASAP if emergency)

#### Intermittent Leave
**Definition:** Leave taken in separate blocks of time (hours or days)

**Common uses:**
- Chemotherapy appointments
- Dialysis (3x per week)
- Chronic condition flare-ups (migraines)
- Reduced work schedule (working 4 days instead of 5)

**Tracking:**
Increment as small as employer's shortest leave increment (e.g., 15-min, 1-hour)

**Example:**
```
Employee has chronic migraines, takes intermittent FMLA

Week 1: Missed Monday (8 hours) → 8 hours FMLA used
Week 2: Left early Tuesday (4 hours) → 4 hours FMLA used
Week 3: Full week worked → 0 hours FMLA used
Week 4: Missed Wed-Fri (24 hours) → 24 hours FMLA used

Total used: 36 hours (4.5 days of 12-week entitlement)
```

#### Reduced Schedule Leave
**Definition:** Employee works fewer hours per day or days per week

**Example:**
- Employee works 20 hours/week instead of 40 for 12 weeks → Uses full 12-week entitlement
- Employee works 30 hours/week instead of 40 for 24 weeks → Uses full 12-week entitlement

**Calculation:**
```
Normal schedule: 40 hours/week
Reduced schedule: 30 hours/week
Reduction: 10 hours/week

Duration: 12 weeks on reduced schedule
FMLA used: 12 weeks (regardless of hours worked)
```

### FMLA Notice and Certification Requirements

#### Employee Notice Requirements

**Foreseeable leave (planned medical procedure, birth):**
- **30 days advance notice** if leave is foreseeable
- If less than 30 days' notice, provide notice ASAP (within 1-2 business days of learning of need)

**Unforeseeable leave (emergency, sudden illness):**
- Notice ASAP (same day or next business day)
- Can be provided by employee or family member
- Verbal notice is sufficient initially

**Acceptable forms of notice:**
- Verbal (in person, phone)
- Email
- Text message
- Through supervisor or HR

**Employee does NOT need to mention "FMLA":**
- Just needs to communicate need for leave and reason
- "I need to take leave for a medical procedure"
- "My father had a heart attack, I need to be with him"
- "I'm having a baby and will need maternity leave"

**Employer's responsibility:** If reason qualifies, designate as FMLA even if employee doesn't request it

#### Medical Certification Requirements

**Employer can require certification for:**
- Employee's own serious health condition
- Family member's serious health condition

**Cannot require certification for:**
- Birth/bonding (can ask for birth certificate)
- Adoption/foster (can ask for placement documents)

**Timelines:**
- Employer must request certification in writing
- Employee has **15 calendar days** to provide
- Employer can give employee more time if needed

**DOL Forms:**
- **WH-380-E:** Employee's own serious health condition
- **WH-380-F:** Family member's serious health condition
- **WH-385:** Military exigency leave
- **WH-385-V:** Military caregiver leave

**What employer can ask:**
- Nature of condition (general description)
- Treatment required
- Expected duration
- Whether condition prevents employee from working

**What employer CANNOT ask:**
- Diagnosis (provider can provide general description without specific diagnosis)
- Medical records
- Details beyond DOL form

**Recertification:**
- Can request every 6 months for chronic conditions
- Every 30 days for conditions with duration >30 days (if reasonable safety concern or doubt certification)

---

### FMLA Designation and Tracking

#### Employer Designation Notice

**Required:** Within 5 business days of receiving sufficient information, employer must provide:

**Designation Notice (DOL Form WH-382):**
- Whether leave is approved as FMLA
- Amount of leave counted against entitlement
- Employee's responsibility to provide fitness-for-duty certification (if required)

**What to include:**
```
"Based on the information provided, your leave request for [reason] is designated as FMLA-qualifying leave.

- Amount approved: 12 weeks (480 hours)
- Leave counting period: [Date] through [Date]
- Leave will be counted as [continuous / intermittent / reduced schedule]
- Fitness-for-duty certification required before return: [Yes/No]

Your FMLA leave balance:
- Total entitlement: 12 weeks (480 hours)
- Previously used: 0 hours
- Approved for this request: 480 hours
- Remaining after this leave: 0 hours"
```

#### Tracking FMLA Leave

**12-month period options - employer chooses one:**

**Option 1: Calendar year** (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
- Simple to track
- Disadvantage: Employee could take 12 weeks in Dec, then 12 more in Jan

**Option 2: Fixed year** (e.g., July 1 - June 30)
- Aligns with fiscal year
- Same disadvantage as calendar year

**Option 3: 12-month rolling backward**
- Look back 12 months from date leave is requested
- Most common method
- Prevents "stacking" leave at year boundaries

**Option 4: 12-month rolling forward**
- 12 months from first day of leave
- Simple once leave starts

**Example - Rolling backward method:**
```
Employee took FMLA leave:
- January 15, 2024: 2 weeks (80 hours)
- June 1, 2024: 3 weeks (120 hours)

New leave request: November 1, 2024
Look back 12 months: November 1, 2023 - November 1, 2024
FMLA used in look-back period: 200 hours (2 weeks + 3 weeks)
Remaining entitlement: 280 hours (480 - 200 = 280)
```

## Leave Interaction - FMLA + State Paid Leave

### How FMLA and State Paid Leave Work Together

**Key principle: FMLA and state paid leave run CONCURRENTLY**

This means:
- Employee gets paid (from state program) while taking FMLA leave
- FMLA 12-week clock runs at same time as state leave
- Employee does not get 12 weeks FMLA + 12 weeks state leave separately

**Example - Washington employee:**
```
Employee has baby, eligible for FMLA + WA PFML

Week 1-12: FMLA + WA PFML run concurrently
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: Yes (WA PFML - 90% wages)
- FMLA used: 12 weeks
- WA PFML used: 12 weeks

Week 13+: No FMLA left, no WA PFML left
- Cannot take additional leave (unless employer grants additional unpaid leave)
```

**Example - California employee (FMLA-eligible):**
```
Employee has baby, eligible for FMLA + CA PFL

Week 1-8: FMLA + CA PFL run concurrently
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: Yes (CA PFL - 60-70% wages)
- FMLA used: 8 weeks
- CA PFL used: 8 weeks

Week 9-12: FMLA only (no more CA PFL)
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: No (CA PFL exhausted)
- Can use accrued PTO or unpaid

Result: 12 weeks job-protected (8 paid, 4 unpaid)
```

---

### Substitution of Paid Leave

**FMLA allows employer to require (or employee to elect) substitution of paid leave:**

**Paid leave types:**
- Vacation
- Sick leave
- PTO

**How it works:**
```
Employee on FMLA for surgery, has 2 weeks PTO accrued

Option 1 - Employer requires substitution:
- Week 1-2: FMLA + PTO (employee gets regular pay from PTO)
- Week 3-6: FMLA only (unpaid)

Option 2 - Employee elects substitution:
- Same as above

Option 3 - No substitution:
- Week 1-6: FMLA (unpaid)
- Employee saves PTO for later
```

**Employer policy determines:**
- Whether substitution is required or voluntary
- Which types of leave can be substituted
- Must be documented in FMLA policy

**State paid leave:**
- Many states (CA, WA) allow employee to use PTO during waiting period (first 7 days)
- Some states allow "top off" - using PTO to supplement state wage replacement (e.g., if state pays 70%, employee can use PTO for remaining 30%)

---

## Leave Administration Best Practices

### Intake Process

**When employee requests leave, HR should:**

**Step 1: Gather information (immediately)**
- Reason for leave
- Expected start date and duration
- Whether related to prior leave

**Step 2: Determine coverage (within 1-2 days)**
- FMLA eligible? (4-part test)
- State leave eligible?
- ADA accommodation needed?

**Step 3: Provide notices (within 5 business days)**
- Eligibility notice (DOL Form WH-381)
- Rights and responsibilities notice (DOL Form WH-381)
- Designation notice (DOL Form WH-382) - once sufficient info received

**Step 4: Request certification (within 5 business days)**
- Medical certification if serious health condition
- Birth certificate or adoption papers if bonding leave

**Step 5: Track leave**
- Set up tracking system (spreadsheet, HRIS)
- Calculate intermittent leave weekly
- Monitor certification deadlines

---

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

#### Mistake 1: Not Designating Leave as FMLA

**Scenario:** Employee calls in sick for 4 days, later reveals it was for surgery. Employer doesn't retroactively designate as FMLA.

**Problem:** Employee uses sick days, then later requests FMLA for different condition. Could have up to 12 weeks + sick days.

**Fix:** Designate leave as FMLA when you learn reason qualifies, even retroactively. Provide designation notice.

#### Mistake 2: Requiring "FMLA Request"

**Scenario:** Employee says "I need time off for surgery" but doesn't say "FMLA." Employer says "you need to request FMLA."

**Problem:** Employee is not required to mention FMLA. Employer must recognize qualifying reason and start FMLA process.

**Fix:** Train managers to recognize FMLA-qualifying reasons and immediately notify HR. HR should start FMLA process proactively.

#### Mistake 3: Denying Intermittent Leave

**Scenario:** Employee requests intermittent FMLA for migraines (1-2 days per month as needed). Employer says "we need you here full-time, denied."

**Problem:** Employer cannot deny intermittent leave if medically necessary and certified by healthcare provider.

**Fix:** If certification supports intermittent leave, approve it. Can ask for recertification every 6 months.

#### Mistake 4: Not Running State Leave Concurrently

**Scenario:** Employee takes 12 weeks CA PFL (paid), then employer says "now you can take 12 weeks FMLA (unpaid)."

**Problem:** FMLA and state leave run concurrently. Employee does not get 24 weeks total.

**Fix:** Designate FMLA and state leave to run at same time. Both clocks tick simultaneously.

#### Mistake 5: Terminating During FMLA

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for 8 weeks. Employer eliminates position due to restructuring, terminates employee.

**Problem:** Even if legitimate business reason, terminating during FMLA creates strong retaliation claim.

**Fix:**
- Delay termination until after FMLA leave ends, if possible
- Document business reason thoroughly
- Show that position would have been eliminated regardless of FMLA
- Consult employment attorney

#### Mistake 6: Requiring 100% Fitness for Return

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for knee surgery, wants to return with restriction "no standing >4 hours." Employer requires "100% fit for duty" to return.

**Problem:** FMLA only requires "able to perform essential functions" - not 100% healed. Requiring 100% may violate ADA.

**Fix:**
- Accept return if employee can perform essential functions (with or without accommodation)
- If restriction needed, start interactive ADA process
- Only if cannot accommodate AND it creates undue hardship can you delay return

#### Mistake 7: Not Communicating with Employee on Leave

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for 12 weeks. Employer has no contact during leave. Employee returns, confused about benefits and projects.

**Problem:** Creates disengagement, confusion. May accidentally violate FMLA if employer sends work-related messages.

**Fix:**
- Check in periodically (once every 2-3 weeks) for benefits, return-to-work planning
- Do NOT discuss work assignments or expect work
- Clarify that employee should not be checking email or working

---

## Documentation Requirements

### What to Keep in FMLA File

**Separate FMLA file (not personnel file):**
- FMLA request (email, form, notes from conversation)
- Eligibility notice (WH-381)
- Rights and responsibilities notice (WH-381)
- Designation notice (WH-382)
- Medical certification (WH-380-E or WH-380-F)
- Correspondence with employee (emails, letters)
- Recertification requests and responses
- Fitness-for-duty certification (if required)
- Leave tracking (intermittent leave hours)

**Why separate file:** Medical information must be kept confidential per ADA

**Retention:** 3 years minimum (DOL requirement)

---

### State-Specific Documentation

**California:**
- CA CFRA notices (separate from FMLA)
- PDL (Pregnancy Disability Leave) documentation if applicable
- EDD claim confirmation for PFL/SDI

**Washington:**
- WA PFML claim number
- Confirmation of wage replacement amount
- Notice of job protection status

**New York:**
- NY PFL request form (via insurance carrier)
- Insurance carrier claim number

---
