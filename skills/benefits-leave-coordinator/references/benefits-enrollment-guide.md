## Decision Support Tools

### Health Plan Comparison Matrix

**Include for all plans:**
- Monthly premium (employee cost)
- Annual deductible (individual & family)
- Out-of-pocket maximum
- Primary care copay
- Specialist copay
- ER visit cost
- Prescription drug costs (generic, brand, specialty)
- Network (PPO, HMO, EPO)

### Cost Calculator Template

**Inputs:**
1. How often do you visit the doctor? [0, 1-2, 3-5, 6+ times/year]
2. Do you take medications regularly? [Yes/No → How many?]
3. Do you see specialists? [Yes/No]
4. Expecting surgery or major procedure? [Yes/No]
5. Do you have chronic conditions? [Yes/No]
6. Coverage tier? [Employee only, +spouse, +children, family]

**Output:**
| Plan | Premium | Est. Medical Costs | Total Annual Cost | **Recommendation** |
|------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PPO | $1,800 | $2,500 | **$4,300** | ⭐ Best for your needs |
| HMO | $1,200 | $3,200 | $4,400 | Good option |
| HDHP | $600 | $5,800 | $6,400 | Higher out-of-pocket |

### HSA vs FSA Decision Tree

**Question 1:** Are you enrolled in a high-deductible health plan?
- **No** → You can only do FSA (not HSA)
- **Yes** → Continue to Q2

**Question 2:** Do you have predictable medical expenses this year?
- **Yes (e.g., planned surgery, regular prescriptions)** → Consider FSA (use it or lose it, but great for known costs)
- **No** → Consider HSA (rolls over, saves for future)

**Question 3:** Can you afford to fund it?
- **HSA contribution limits:** $4,150 individual / $8,300 family (2024)
- **FSA contribution limits:** $3,200 (2024)

**Recommendation:**
- Healthy + want to save long-term = **HSA**
- Know you'll spend it this year = **FSA**

## Employee Q&A: Top 20 Questions

### About Enrollment Process

**Q1: What happens if I don't enroll?**
A: [Passive enrollment - you keep current elections with new rates / Active enrollment required - you lose coverage]

**Q2: Can I change my elections mid-year?**
A: Generally no, unless you have a qualifying life event (marriage, birth, divorce, loss of coverage). Changes must be made within 30 days of the event.

**Q3: When does my new coverage start?**
A: January 1, 2025 (typically first day of new plan year).

**Q4: I made a mistake. Can I change it?**

---

### About Health Plans

**Q5: What's the difference between PPO, HMO, and HDHP?**
A:
- **PPO:** Flexibility to see any provider, no referrals needed, higher premiums
- **HMO:** Lower premiums, must choose primary care doctor, need referrals for specialists, network restrictions
- **HDHP:** Lowest premiums, high deductible, pairs with HSA for tax savings

**Q6: Can I keep my current doctor?**
A: Check the provider directory for your chosen plan. Networks may change year-to-year.

**Q7: What's a deductible vs. out-of-pocket maximum?**
A:
- **Deductible:** Amount you pay before insurance starts paying (except preventive care)
- **Out-of-pocket max:** Most you'll pay in a year (after this, insurance pays 100%)

---

**Q10: What happens to my FSA money if I don't use it?**
A: Use-it-or-lose-it (with grace period or carryover if company offers). HSA rolls over indefinitely.

3. **Multiple channels** - Email, Slack, meetings, webinars, 1:1s
4. **Manager engagement** - Equip managers to support teams
5. **Decision support** - Tools, calculators, comparisons (not just plan documents)
6. **Accessibility** - Offer help for those who struggle with online enrollment
