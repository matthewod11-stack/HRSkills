## Federal FMLA (Family and Medical Leave Act)

### What FMLA Covers

**12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for:**

1. **Birth and care of newborn child** (within 1 year of birth)
2. **Adoption or foster care placement** (within 1 year of placement)
3. **Care for spouse, child, or parent with serious health condition**
4. **Employee's own serious health condition** that makes them unable to work
5. **Qualifying exigency** due to family member's military deployment

**26 weeks for military caregiver leave** (caring for covered service member)

---

### FMLA Eligibility - All 4 Must Be Met

#### 1. Employer Coverage
**Private employers:** 50+ employees for 20+ workweeks in current or prior calendar year
**Public agencies:** All covered (federal, state, local government)
**Schools:** All public and private elementary/secondary schools

**Counting employees:**
- Count all employees on payroll (including part-time, temp, on leave)
- Don't need to be at same location
- Count across all worksites nationally

#### 2. Employee Tenure - 12 Months
**Requirement:** Employed for at least 12 months (doesn't need to be consecutive)

**Common scenarios:**
- Employee worked 8 months, left, returned 6 months later → Eligible (14 total months)
- Employee on unpaid leave for 3 months → Leave time counts toward 12-month requirement
- Acquired company → Prior employment counts if there was no break in service

**Calculation:**
```
Hire date: [Date]
Gaps in employment: [Any breaks in service?]
Total tenure: [X months]
Eligible? [Yes/No]
```

#### 3. Hours Worked - 1,250 in Last 12 Months
**Requirement:** Worked at least 1,250 hours in the 12 months immediately before leave starts

**What counts:**
- All hours worked (regular, overtime, training)
- Paid leave (vacation, sick, holidays)
- Does NOT count: Unpaid leave, breaks

**Calculation:**
```
1,250 hours = approximately 24 hours/week for 52 weeks

Look back period: [Leave start date] back 12 months to [date]
Hours worked: [X hours]
Eligible? [Yes/No]
```

**Common scenarios:**
- Part-time employee (20 hrs/week) → 1,040 hours/year → NOT eligible
- Part-time employee (25 hrs/week) → 1,300 hours/year → Eligible
- Employee increased hours 6 months ago → May now be eligible, recalculate

#### 4. Worksite - 50 Employees Within 75 Miles
**Requirement:** Works at location where employer has 50+ employees within 75-mile radius

**How to calculate:**
- Measure straight-line distance ("as the crow flies"), not driving distance
- Include all employees within radius (not just at employee's specific office)
- Include employees on leave, part-time, temporary

**Example:**
```
Employee worksite: Seattle office (30 employees)
Other locations within 75 miles:
- Bellevue office: 25 employees (10 miles away)
- Tacoma office: 20 employees (32 miles away)
Total within 75 miles: 75 employees → Eligible

Employee worksite: Remote worker in rural Montana
Nearest office: 120 miles away → NOT eligible
```

### FMLA Leave Reasons - Deep Dive

#### Reason 1: Serious Health Condition (Employee or Family Member)

**Definition of "serious health condition":**

**YES - Qualifies:**
- Overnight hospitalization
- Incapacity for 3+ consecutive days + 2+ doctor visits or 1 visit + continuing treatment
- Chronic conditions requiring periodic treatment (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, migraines)
- Pregnancy complications (morning sickness that requires treatment)
- Prenatal care
- Substance abuse treatment (inpatient or supervised by healthcare provider)

**NO - Does not qualify:**
- Common cold, flu (unless complications)
- Routine dental/orthodontic appointments
- Cosmetic procedures (unless complications)
- Voluntary cosmetic treatments

**Medical certification required:**
- DOL Form WH-380-E (employee's condition) or WH-380-F (family member)
- Healthcare provider must complete
- Due within 15 calendar days of request

#### Reason 2: Birth/Bonding with Newborn

**Eligible parents:**
- Birth mother (also eligible for her own serious health condition)
- Father
- Domestic partner (if state recognizes)

**Timeframe:** Must be taken within 12 months of birth

**Can be taken:**
- All at once (12 weeks)
- Intermittently (e.g., 1 day per week for 12 weeks = 12 days)
- If employer approves intermittent bonding leave

**Spouses working for same employer:**
- Limited to combined 12 weeks for birth/bonding
- Each parent gets own 12 weeks for serious health condition

#### Reason 3: Adoption or Foster Care Placement

**Same rules as birth:**
- 12 weeks within 1 year of placement
- Both parents eligible (combined 12 weeks if same employer)

**Covers:**
- Pre-placement meetings
- Required counseling
- Court proceedings

#### Reason 4: Military Family Leave

**Qualifying exigency leave (12 weeks):**
- Family member called to active duty (National Guard/Reserves)
- Covers: Legal/financial arrangements, counseling, childcare, attending military events

**Military caregiver leave (26 weeks in single 12-month period):**
- Caring for covered service member (current or veteran) with serious injury/illness
- Veteran must have been discharged within 5 years

---

### FMLA Leave Types

#### Continuous Leave
**Definition:** Employee off work continuously for days/weeks

**Example:**
- Surgery with 6-week recovery
- Maternity leave (6 weeks postpartum)

**Administration:**
- Track as single block of time
- Employee must provide notice (30 days if foreseeable, ASAP if emergency)

#### Intermittent Leave
**Definition:** Leave taken in separate blocks of time (hours or days)

**Common uses:**
- Chemotherapy appointments
- Dialysis (3x per week)
- Chronic condition flare-ups (migraines)
- Reduced work schedule (working 4 days instead of 5)

**Tracking:**
Increment as small as employer's shortest leave increment (e.g., 15-min, 1-hour)

**Example:**
```
Employee has chronic migraines, takes intermittent FMLA

Week 1: Missed Monday (8 hours) → 8 hours FMLA used
Week 2: Left early Tuesday (4 hours) → 4 hours FMLA used
Week 3: Full week worked → 0 hours FMLA used
Week 4: Missed Wed-Fri (24 hours) → 24 hours FMLA used

Total used: 36 hours (4.5 days of 12-week entitlement)
```

#### Reduced Schedule Leave
**Definition:** Employee works fewer hours per day or days per week

**Example:**
- Employee works 20 hours/week instead of 40 for 12 weeks → Uses full 12-week entitlement
- Employee works 30 hours/week instead of 40 for 24 weeks → Uses full 12-week entitlement

**Calculation:**
```
Normal schedule: 40 hours/week
Reduced schedule: 30 hours/week
Reduction: 10 hours/week

Duration: 12 weeks on reduced schedule
FMLA used: 12 weeks (regardless of hours worked)
```

### FMLA Notice and Certification Requirements

#### Employee Notice Requirements

**Foreseeable leave (planned medical procedure, birth):**
- **30 days advance notice** if leave is foreseeable
- If less than 30 days' notice, provide notice ASAP (within 1-2 business days of learning of need)

**Unforeseeable leave (emergency, sudden illness):**
- Notice ASAP (same day or next business day)
- Can be provided by employee or family member
- Verbal notice is sufficient initially

**Acceptable forms of notice:**
- Verbal (in person, phone)
- Email
- Text message
- Through supervisor or HR

**Employee does NOT need to mention "FMLA":**
- Just needs to communicate need for leave and reason
- "I need to take leave for a medical procedure"
- "My father had a heart attack, I need to be with him"
- "I'm having a baby and will need maternity leave"

**Employer's responsibility:** If reason qualifies, designate as FMLA even if employee doesn't request it

#### Medical Certification Requirements

**Employer can require certification for:**
- Employee's own serious health condition
- Family member's serious health condition

**Cannot require certification for:**
- Birth/bonding (can ask for birth certificate)
- Adoption/foster (can ask for placement documents)

**Timelines:**
- Employer must request certification in writing
- Employee has **15 calendar days** to provide
- Employer can give employee more time if needed

**DOL Forms:**
- **WH-380-E:** Employee's own serious health condition
- **WH-380-F:** Family member's serious health condition
- **WH-385:** Military exigency leave
- **WH-385-V:** Military caregiver leave

**What employer can ask:**
- Nature of condition (general description)
- Treatment required
- Expected duration
- Whether condition prevents employee from working

**What employer CANNOT ask:**

- Medical records
- Details beyond DOL form

**Recertification:**
- Can request every 6 months for chronic conditions
- Every 30 days for conditions with duration >30 days (if reasonable safety concern or doubt certification)

---

### FMLA Designation and Tracking

#### Employer Designation Notice

**Required:** Within 5 business days of receiving sufficient information, employer must provide:

**Designation Notice (DOL Form WH-382):**
- Whether leave is approved as FMLA
- Amount of leave counted against entitlement
- Employee's responsibility to provide fitness-for-duty certification (if required)

**What to include:**
```
"Based on the information provided, your leave request for [reason] is designated as FMLA-qualifying leave.

- Amount approved: 12 weeks (480 hours)
- Leave counting period: [Date] through [Date]
- Leave will be counted as [continuous / intermittent / reduced schedule]
- Fitness-for-duty certification required before return: [Yes/No]

Your FMLA leave balance:
- Total entitlement: 12 weeks (480 hours)
- Previously used: 0 hours
- Approved for this request: 480 hours
- Remaining after this leave: 0 hours"
```

#### Tracking FMLA Leave

**12-month period options - employer chooses one:**

**Option 1: Calendar year** (Jan 1 - Dec 31)
- Simple to track
- Disadvantage: Employee could take 12 weeks in Dec, then 12 more in Jan

**Option 2: Fixed year** (e.g., July 1 - June 30)
- Aligns with fiscal year
- Same disadvantage as calendar year

**Option 3: 12-month rolling backward**
- Look back 12 months from date leave is requested
- Most common method
- Prevents "stacking" leave at year boundaries

**Option 4: 12-month rolling forward**
- 12 months from first day of leave
- Simple once leave starts

**Example - Rolling backward method:**
```
Employee took FMLA leave:
- January 15, 2024: 2 weeks (80 hours)
- June 1, 2024: 3 weeks (120 hours)

New leave request: November 1, 2024
Look back 12 months: November 1, 2023 - November 1, 2024
FMLA used in look-back period: 200 hours (2 weeks + 3 weeks)
Remaining entitlement: 280 hours (480 - 200 = 280)
```

## Leave Interaction - FMLA + State Paid Leave

### How FMLA and State Paid Leave Work Together

**Key principle: FMLA and state paid leave run CONCURRENTLY**

This means:
- Employee gets paid (from state program) while taking FMLA leave
- FMLA 12-week clock runs at same time as state leave
- Employee does not get 12 weeks FMLA + 12 weeks state leave separately

**Example - Washington employee:**
```
Employee has baby, eligible for FMLA + WA PFML

Week 1-12: FMLA + WA PFML run concurrently
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: Yes (WA PFML - 90% wages)
- FMLA used: 12 weeks
- WA PFML used: 12 weeks

Week 13+: No FMLA left, no WA PFML left
- Cannot take additional leave (unless employer grants additional unpaid leave)
```

**Example - California employee (FMLA-eligible):**
```
Employee has baby, eligible for FMLA + CA PFL

Week 1-8: FMLA + CA PFL run concurrently
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: Yes (CA PFL - 60-70% wages)
- FMLA used: 8 weeks
- CA PFL used: 8 weeks

Week 9-12: FMLA only (no more CA PFL)
- Job-protected: Yes (FMLA)
- Paid: No (CA PFL exhausted)
- Can use accrued PTO or unpaid

Result: 12 weeks job-protected (8 paid, 4 unpaid)
```

---

### Substitution of Paid Leave

**FMLA allows employer to require (or employee to elect) substitution of paid leave:**

**Paid leave types:**
- Vacation
- Sick leave
- PTO

**How it works:**
```
Employee on FMLA for surgery, has 2 weeks PTO accrued

Option 1 - Employer requires substitution:
- Week 1-2: FMLA + PTO (employee gets regular pay from PTO)
- Week 3-6: FMLA only (unpaid)

Option 2 - Employee elects substitution:
- Same as above

Option 3 - No substitution:
- Week 1-6: FMLA (unpaid)
- Employee saves PTO for later
```

**Employer policy determines:**
- Whether substitution is required or voluntary
- Which types of leave can be substituted
- Must be documented in FMLA policy

**State paid leave:**
- Many states (CA, WA) allow employee to use PTO during waiting period (first 7 days)
- Some states allow "top off" - using PTO to supplement state wage replacement (e.g., if state pays 70%, employee can use PTO for remaining 30%)

---

## Leave Administration Best Practices

### Intake Process

**When employee requests leave, HR should:**

**Step 1: Gather information (immediately)**
- Reason for leave
- Expected start date and duration
- Whether related to prior leave

**Step 2: Determine coverage (within 1-2 days)**
- FMLA eligible? (4-part test)
- State leave eligible?
- ADA accommodation needed?

**Step 3: Provide notices (within 5 business days)**
- Eligibility notice (DOL Form WH-381)
- Rights and responsibilities notice (DOL Form WH-381)
- Designation notice (DOL Form WH-382) - once sufficient info received

**Step 4: Request certification (within 5 business days)**
- Medical certification if serious health condition
- Birth certificate or adoption papers if bonding leave

**Step 5: Track leave**
- Set up tracking system (spreadsheet, HRIS)
- Calculate intermittent leave weekly
- Monitor certification deadlines

---

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

#### Mistake 1: Not Designating Leave as FMLA

**Scenario:** Employee calls in sick for 4 days, later reveals it was for surgery. Employer doesn't retroactively designate as FMLA.

**Problem:** Employee uses sick days, then later requests FMLA for different condition. Could have up to 12 weeks + sick days.

**Fix:** Designate leave as FMLA when you learn reason qualifies, even retroactively. Provide designation notice.

#### Mistake 2: Requiring "FMLA Request"

**Scenario:** Employee says "I need time off for surgery" but doesn't say "FMLA." Employer says "you need to request FMLA."

**Problem:** Employee is not required to mention FMLA. Employer must recognize qualifying reason and start FMLA process.

**Fix:** Train managers to recognize FMLA-qualifying reasons and immediately notify HR. HR should start FMLA process proactively.

#### Mistake 3: Denying Intermittent Leave

**Scenario:** Employee requests intermittent FMLA for migraines (1-2 days per month as needed). Employer says "we need you here full-time, denied."

**Problem:** Employer cannot deny intermittent leave if medically necessary and certified by healthcare provider.

**Fix:** If certification supports intermittent leave, approve it. Can ask for recertification every 6 months.

#### Mistake 4: Not Running State Leave Concurrently

**Scenario:** Employee takes 12 weeks CA PFL (paid), then employer says "now you can take 12 weeks FMLA (unpaid)."

**Problem:** FMLA and state leave run concurrently. Employee does not get 24 weeks total.

**Fix:** Designate FMLA and state leave to run at same time. Both clocks tick simultaneously.

#### Mistake 5: Terminating During FMLA

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for 8 weeks. Employer eliminates position due to restructuring, terminates employee.

**Problem:** Even if legitimate business reason, terminating during FMLA creates strong retaliation claim.

**Fix:**
- Delay termination until after FMLA leave ends, if possible
- Document business reason thoroughly
- Show that position would have been eliminated regardless of FMLA
- Consult employment attorney

#### Mistake 6: Requiring 100% Fitness for Return

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for knee surgery, wants to return with restriction "no standing >4 hours." Employer requires "100% fit for duty" to return.

**Problem:** FMLA only requires "able to perform essential functions" - not 100% healed. Requiring 100% may violate ADA.

**Fix:**
- Accept return if employee can perform essential functions (with or without accommodation)
- If restriction needed, start interactive ADA process
- Only if cannot accommodate AND it creates undue hardship can you delay return

#### Mistake 7: Not Communicating with Employee on Leave

**Scenario:** Employee on FMLA for 12 weeks. Employer has no contact during leave. Employee returns, confused about benefits and projects.

**Problem:** Creates disengagement, confusion. May accidentally violate FMLA if employer sends work-related messages.

**Fix:**
- Check in periodically (once every 2-3 weeks) for benefits, return-to-work planning
- Do NOT discuss work assignments or expect work
- Clarify that employee should not be checking email or working

---

## Documentation Requirements

### What to Keep in FMLA File

**Separate FMLA file (not personnel file):**
- FMLA request (email, form, notes from conversation)
- Eligibility notice (WH-381)
- Rights and responsibilities notice (WH-381)
- Designation notice (WH-382)
- Medical certification (WH-380-E or WH-380-F)
- Correspondence with employee (emails, letters)
- Recertification requests and responses
- Fitness-for-duty certification (if required)
- Leave tracking (intermittent leave hours)

**Why separate file:** Medical information must be kept confidential per ADA

**Retention:** 3 years minimum (DOL requirement)

---

### State-Specific Documentation

**California:**
- CA CFRA notices (separate from FMLA)
- PDL (Pregnancy Disability Leave) documentation if applicable
- EDD claim confirmation for PFL/SDI

**Washington:**
- WA PFML claim number
- Confirmation of wage replacement amount
- Notice of job protection status

**New York:**
- NY PFL request form (via insurance carrier)
- Insurance carrier claim number

---
