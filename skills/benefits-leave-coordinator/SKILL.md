## When to Use This Skill

Users will ask you to:
- "How do I plan open enrollment?"
- "Is this employee eligible for FMLA?"
- "What's the difference between FMLA and state leave in California?"
- "Employee's having a baby - what benefits and leave do they get?"
- "How do I handle a return-to-work after medical leave?"
- "Create open enrollment communication timeline"
- "What leave laws apply to our remote employees in different states?"

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Compliance is Non-Negotiable

**Federal laws:**
- **FMLA** (Family Medical Leave Act) - 12 weeks unpaid leave, job-protected
- **ACA** (Affordable Care Act) - Health insurance requirements
- **COBRA** - Continuation coverage after employment ends
- **ERISA** - Retirement plan regulations

**State laws vary significantly:**
- Paid family leave (CA, NY, WA, NJ, etc.)
- Pregnancy disability leave
- Sick leave requirements
- Breaks for nursing mothers

**Get it wrong = fines, lawsuits, employee harm**

---

### 2. Employee Communication is Critical

**Benefits are complex:**
- Employees don't understand jargon
- Choices have major financial impact
- Deadlines are strict (miss enrollment = no coverage)

**Your role:**
- Translate benefits into plain language
- Provide decision support tools
- Set clear deadlines
- Multiple communication channels

---

### 3. Document Everything

**For leave administration:**
- All leave requests
- Medical certifications
- Manager approvals
- Denials with reasons
- Return-to-work clearances

**Why:** FMLA/ADA lawsuits require documentation proving compliance

---

### 4. Be Proactive About Life Events

**Life events trigger benefits changes:**
- Marriage, divorce, legal separation
- Birth, adoption, foster placement
- Death of dependent
- Loss of other coverage
- Change in employment status

**30-day window for most changes - remind employees**

---

## Manager Enablement

**Manager Talking Points:**
```
"Open enrollment is coming up [dates]. Here's what you need to know to support your team:

**Your Role:**
- Remind your team to enroll (don't wait until last day)
- Encourage them to review changes (rates, plan options)
- Point them to HR resources (guide, calculator, Q&A sessions)
- Be available for questions (but refer complex questions to HR)

**Common Questions:**

- "Can I change mid-year?" → No, unless you have a qualifying life event (marriage, birth, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Give medical or benefits advice (you're not qualified)
- Pressure employees toward specific plan choices
- Share your own personal benefits decisions (may influence them)

Questions? Escalate to HR."

## Leave Tracking and Documentation

**Maintain in confidential leave file (separate from personnel file):**
- [ ] Leave request (email, form, verbal documented)
- [ ] Eligibility determination
- [ ] Medical certification (WH-380)
- [ ] Designation notice
- [ ] Communication with employee during leave
- [ ] Recertifications (if applicable)
- [ ] Fitness-for-duty certification (before return)
- [ ] Return-to-work documentation

**Track leave usage:**
- Hours/days used
- Remaining FMLA balance
- Update every pay period

---

## Intermittent Leave

**What is it:** Leave taken in separate blocks (e.g., weekly therapy) or reduced schedule (e.g., work 4 days/week)

**When allowed:**
- Employee's own serious health condition (chronic - e.g., cancer treatment)
- Care for family member (chronic condition)
- **NOT allowed** for birth/bonding (must be continuous unless employer agrees)

**Challenges:**
- Tracking is complex (hours vs. days)
- Scheduling disruptions
- Abuse concerns

**Management:**
- Require recertification every 30 days
- Document each absence as FMLA
- Track hours used
- Cannot discipline for FMLA-protected absences (but can discipline for non-FMLA absences)

---

## Return to Work

**Before employee returns:**
- [ ] Fitness-for-duty certification (if required)
  - Must be job-related and consistent with business necessity
  - Typically for serious health conditions
  - Specify essential functions employee must perform
- [ ] Confirm return date with employee
- [ ] Prepare workstation, system access
- [ ] Notify manager and team

**Upon return:**
- [ ] Reinstate to same or equivalent position
  - Same pay, benefits, terms and conditions
  - "Equivalent" means virtually identical, not just comparable
- [ ] Update leave balance
- [ ] Close leave case file (or keep open if recurring)

**Cannot:**
- Assign to worse position ("We already filled your role")
- Reduce pay or hours
- Change shift or location to employee's detriment
- Count FMLA leave against attendance policy

---

## State Leave Laws (Must Comply with Both FMLA and State)

### California - CFRA + PDL

**CFRA (California Family Rights Act):**
- Similar to FMLA but broader
- Employers with 5+ employees (vs. 50+ for FMLA)
- Includes leave for domestic partners
- Does NOT include employee's own pregnancy disability (that's PDL)

**PDL (Pregnancy Disability Leave):**
- Up to 4 months for pregnancy disability
- THEN eligible for 12 weeks CFRA for baby bonding
- Total: Up to 4 months PDL + 12 weeks CFRA = ~7 months

**CA Paid Family Leave (PFL):**
- State-paid benefit (not employer cost)
- Up to 8 weeks paid at ~60-70% wages
- Coordinates with FMLA/CFRA (runs concurrently)

---

### Washington - PFML (Paid Family Medical Leave)

**Coverage:**
- 12 weeks medical leave
- 12 weeks family leave
- 2 weeks pregnancy complication
- Total max: 16-18 weeks combined

**Paid:** Yes, state-funded at 90% of wages (up to cap)

**Eligibility:** 820 hours in past year (vs. 1,250 for FMLA)

---

### New York - PFL (Paid Family Leave)

**Coverage:**
- 12 weeks paid family leave (bond with child, care for family member, military)
- Does NOT cover employee's own medical leave (use disability)

**Paid:** Yes, 67% of wages (up to cap)

**Eligibility:** Regular schedule for 26 weeks OR 175 days worked

---

### Other States with Paid Leave:
- **New Jersey:** 12 weeks, 85% wages
- **Rhode Island:** 5 weeks, 60% wages
- **Massachusetts:** 12 weeks medical, 12 weeks family, 80% wages
- **Connecticut:** 12 weeks, 95% wages (phasing in)
- **Oregon, Colorado, Delaware:** Programs starting 2023-2026

**Key:** State leave often runs concurrently with FMLA (12 weeks total, but paid by state)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Failing to Recognize FMLA-Qualifying Request
**Problem:** Employee says "I need time off for surgery" but you treat as regular PTO

**Fix:** When employee mentions medical condition, family member care, birth, or adoption, investigate if FMLA applies

---

### Mistake 2: Missing Deadlines
**Problem:** Don't send eligibility notice within 5 days

**Fix:** Calendar all FMLA deadlines, set reminders

---

### Mistake 3: Disciplining for FMLA-Protected Absences
**Problem:** Employee on intermittent FMLA, you count absences in attendance policy

**Fix:** Track FMLA vs. non-FMLA absences separately. Can discipline only for non-FMLA absences

---

### Mistake 4: Retaliating After Leave
**Problem:** Employee returns from FMLA, you assign to worse shift "because we needed to fill your spot"

**Fix:** Reinstate to same or equivalent position. If role truly eliminated (RIF), show legitimate business reason unrelated to FMLA

---

### Mistake 5: Not Maintaining Confidentiality
**Problem:** Tell whole team about employee's medical condition

**Fix:** Medical information must be kept confidential. Share only need-to-know (manager knows "employee on approved leave," not diagnosis)

---

## Key Principles

1. **Eligibility is technical** - Check all 4 requirements every time
2. **Deadlines matter** - 5-day notices, 15-day certifications
3. **Document everything** - Your records prove compliance
4. **State law may be more generous** - Apply whichever is better for employee
5. **Job protection is real** - Cannot retaliate or deny reinstatement
6. **Confidentiality is required** - Medical info stays private

Benefits and leave administration protects employees' health and family time while protecting the company from legal liability. Get it right.
