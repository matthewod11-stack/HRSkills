# HR COMMAND CENTER - DESIGN SYSTEM ANALYSIS

**Date:** November 4, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Design system needs proper token architecture, component documentation, and Storybook setup.

---

You are a UI/UX refiner. I want to visually upgrade this HR Command Center dashboard. 
Keep the exact same layout, component hierarchy, and functionality — only improve the color palette, typography, and visual polish.

Here’s what to apply:

🎨 **Color Palette (Option B — Violet–Slate)**
- Background: #121212
- Panel / Card background: #1E1B24
- Accent (primary): #8B5CF6
- Accent highlight: #A78BFA
- Text primary: #F3F4F6
- Text secondary: #9CA3AF
- Border: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
- Success: #10B981
- Warning: #FACC15
- Error: #EF4444

Typography:
- Use **Roboto** font throughout.
- Headings: weight 600–700
- Body: weight 400, text color rgba(255,255,255,0.9)
- Metric numbers: slightly larger, #F9FAFB

Component & Styling Enhancements:
- Add subtle borders around cards (`1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)`).
- Use soft shadows for depth: `0 2px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`.
- Buttons: flat style with hover glow (`box-shadow: 0 0 8px var(--accent)`).
- Graphs & indicators: use muted gradients (violet → light violet) instead of bright neon.
- Background: apply a radial gradient (`center #121212 → edges #0B0B0B`) for subtle depth.
- Hover effects: panels lift slightly with increased shadow on hover.
- Smooth transitions on hover/focus (ease-in, 150–200ms).

Please update the stylesheet or Tailwind config to reflect these tokens, and ensure the result feels premium, cohesive, and easy on the eyes while preserving the dark aesthetic.

Do not modify any component layout, markup, or functionality — just visual and typographic layers.
